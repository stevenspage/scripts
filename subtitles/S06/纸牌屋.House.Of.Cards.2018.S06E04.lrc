[19:03.44]-不重要  他听到风声了  -谁透的风 - Doesn't matter. He got wind of it. - From who?
[19:06.67]重点在于  他是个贪婪的 The point is, is he is a greedy...
[19:08.70]王八蛋  没错 Motherfucker, yes.
[19:09.76]贪婪的王八蛋总是会察觉 And greedy motherfuckers always find out.

[19:23.02]我知道佩特罗夫能打的所有招数 I know every angle Petrov will keep in play.
[19:27.10]他对对手的犹疑极其敏感 He has a sixth sense when it comes to hesitation.
[19:33.38]如果你需要我参与... If you need me to be in there...

[20:40.48]有件事该告诉他的 There was something he needed to know.
[20:43.90]那是个错误 It was a mistake.
[20:46.85]没有让弗兰西斯当国务卿 Overlooking Francis for secretary of state.
[20:49.81]-琳达  都过去了  -不对 - Linda, it's water under the bridge. - No.

[21:03.07]整个国家 This country.
[21:05.71]当然  现在我也没法对他说了 Obviously, there's no way for me to tell him that now.

[21:11.32]你不必这样的 There is no need for that.
[21:13.41]他那些罪行  你打算怎么撇清关系 How do you expect to separate yourself from his crimes?
[21:17.20]虽然我们容忍政治变得如此腐败 As corrupt as these politics we put up with have become...
[21:22.75]但反对你的人怎么会不加以利用呢 how can the people against you not use it?
[21:27.64]你以为你能清白脱身  克莱尔 You thought you got away with it all, Claire.
[21:30.42]但结果还不一定呢 But that remains to be seen.
[21:36.04]发生的一切  都是该发生的 Everything happens exactly as it should.
[21:42.12]见到你很高兴 Nice seeing you.
[21:57.13]你在想什么呢 What are you up to?
[22:01.26]我在想生死之事 I'm thinking about mortality.

[22:07.04]一会儿要开个会 We're about to have a meeting.
[22:08.62]我参与不了  维克多太了解我了 I can't be a part of it. Viktor knows me all too well.

[22:48.21]我会逐渐瓦解比尔和安奈特·谢泼德的影响力 I will chip away at Bill and Annette Shepherd.
[22:53.64]因为要想把他们彻底扳倒 Because the only way to truly take them down
[22:57.81]就只能步步为营 is one piece at a time.
[23:04.60]你认为凯茜到底发生什么了 What do you think really happened to Cathy?

[23:28.04]总统愿意对海岸归属不持异议 the President is willing to leave the coast uncontested.
[23:30.95]-塔尔图斯港  -已经是我们的了 - Tartus... - That port is already ours.
[23:33.06]你们可以继续保留 And will remain so.
[23:34.43]我们的军力将远离西海岸 We'll keep our forces away from the entire Western coast.
[23:37.21]这样你们就可以自由进出地中海 This will give you unfettered access to the Mediterranean.
[23:39.77]-不行  -先生  第六舰队已经出发了 - No. - Sir, the Sixth Fleet is en route.
[23:42.24]-不行  -如果你想引发海军对峙的话 - No. - If you want a naval standoff...
[23:43.86]打住  咱们都不要装了 No! Let's not pretend.
[23:46.33]对你们而言真正重要的是从中取利... What's really at stake here is your country lining its pockets and...
[23:51.84]总统女士 Madam President,
[23:53.63]总统先生 Mr. President,
[23:55.12]-副总统要求我参会  -格雷森先生 - the vice president asked me to join. - Mr. Grayson...
[23:57.71]我代表的是一家 On behalf of a company
[23:58.74]-在中东有业务的公司  -你说什么 - with subsidiaries in the Middle East. - Excuse me.
[24:00.89]我们希望谈判结果能照顾到我方利益 We want to ensure that we're part of the solution.
[24:03.58]这将向全世界发出信号  俄罗斯回来了 This will signal to the world that Russia is back.
[24:06.63]-俄罗斯回来了  -副总统先生 - Russia's back? - Mr. Vice President,
[24:08.28]正在谈判的一些条件还需要进一步讨论 there are terms being negotiated here that need to be discussed...
[24:11.33]天啊 Christ!

[24:14.95]我们早就过了假模假式的环节 we'd be long past this posturing
[24:16.89]-去解决真正问题了  -没错  区域和平 - and dealing with the real question. - Yes, peace in the region.
[24:19.82]和平  不是吧 Peace? Really?
[24:22.21]你想用和平来决定 You want to use peace to decide
[24:24.76]谁来重建这个пиздеть who will rebuild this pizdets?
[24:28.76]我不知道那是什么意思 I don't understand what that means,
[24:30.39]-总统先生  -意思是粪坑 - Mr. President. - That means clusterfuck.
[24:33.73]先生  维持区域稳定对大家都有好处 Sir, stability in the region helps all of us.
[24:36.32]你们想把西部给我  拿走东部 You want to give me the West and take the East?
[24:40.02]真是第一次听说 That's a first.
[24:41.83]那么我的条件如下 So, here's what I want.
[24:43.74]港口我们当然要 The ports, yes, of course.
[24:45.77]但我还要求俄罗斯 But I also want Russian
[24:46.95]独占所有近海石油和天然气开发 exclusivity on all offshore oil and gas exploration.
[24:50.27]-这个得商量一下  -闭嘴吧你 - I think we need to wait. - Shut up.
[24:53.39]我们不能进得去 We can't be in a position where we can get in,
[24:55.25]却不能把资源带出来 and we can't get our resources out.
[24:56.58]历史留给我们的经验  就是 If history has taught us anything, it's that
[24:59.07]美国人总有办法全身而退 the Americans always find a way to leave,
[25:01.22]无论代价多大 no matter what it costs them.
[25:03.67]那么 So...
[25:05.92]有什么想法吗  总统女士 thoughts, Madam President?
[25:12.20]有话说吗 Anything?
[25:19.08]我同意副总统的看法 I concur with the vice president.
[25:28.08]看来我们还有很多需要考虑 I believe we have much to consider.
[25:41.77]示弱太累了 Playing incompetent is so exhausting.
[25:48.76]这一份是总统今晚 Here's a copy of the President's remarks
[25:50.24]在国务卿追悼会上的讲话复本 for the secretary's memorial this evening.
[25:51.99]我已经有一份了 I already have a copy.
[25:53.65]这一份有她在车上做的修改 It includes the changes she made in the car.
[25:55.95]好的  谢谢 Right. Thank you.
[26:02.39]话说汤姆·耶茨真的失踪了吗 Is it true Tom Yates is missing?
[26:04.48]看来是 I believe so.
[26:06.94]他真的和白宫里的什么人有一腿吗 Is it true he had an affair with somebody in the White House?
[26:11.25]是你吗 Was it you?
[26:12.70]什么 Excuse me.
[26:17.28]我会看一看的 I'll look through this.
[26:32.15]谢谢 Thank you.
[26:37.09]-我不喜欢撒谎的人  -我也是 - I don't like liars. - Me neither.
[26:40.02]你为什么让我以为... Why would you let me believe...
[26:41.05]你似乎想让我为凯茜的死负责 It seemed like you wanted me to be the one responsible for Cathy.
[26:44.74]这可能对你有帮助 That it might be useful to you somehow.
[26:50.22]每次我想抽身  就会出什么意外 Every time I plan to quit, something happens.
[26:56.12]弗兰西斯一定对我很失望 Francis would certainly be disappointed in me.
[27:02.73]不是好习惯 Terrible habit.
[27:05.88]不过我戒酒时帮了我的忙 Helped me though when I quit drinking.
[27:10.21]不要对联邦检察官开口  道格 Don't say anything to the US attorney, Doug.
[27:12.97]她在和谢泼德家族合作 She's working with the Shepherds.
[27:16.11]我今晚就赦免你 I pardon you tonight,
[27:17.35]她手上你的任何把柄就是我的问题了 and anything else she has will be my problem.
[27:21.96]我永远都是你的问题 I'll always be a problem for you.
[27:23.88]你还想要我怎样  道格 What do you want from me, Doug?
[27:26.19]现在筹码都在你的手上 You're the one with all the leverage here.
[27:29.55]科尔议员  我让他跟我一起竞选2020 Congressman Cole. I'll put him?on my ticket 2020.
[27:33.33]马克一定会走人  我能肯定 Mark won't survive, I'm sure of it.
[27:35.65]2024年  布雷特·科尔就是总统 2024, Brett Cole will be the President.
[27:38.23]你就能重回白宫 And you will be back in the White House.
[27:42.89]我们可以把他推上总统宝座 We can make him president,
[27:45.72]就像我们帮弗兰西斯那样 just like we did with Francis.
[27:49.26]和科尔搭档的话就是正副不同党了 Cole will mean a split ticket.
[27:51.72]也许这正是我们国家最需要的呢 And that might be the very best thing for this country.
[27:58.65]那你也得赦免弗兰西斯 Pardon Francis as well.
[28:03.53]那我就会被弹劾 If I do that, I could get impeached.
[28:05.63]不会 No.
[28:07.53]你总能活下来  你已经证明了这一点 You're a survivor. You've proven that much.
[28:12.15]赦免他 Pardon him as well.
[28:16.43]比尔绝对无法接受 Bill's gonna hate anything
[28:17.83]跟克里姆林宫任何形式的合作 even approaching a partnership with the Kremlin.
[28:19.86]记仇的是他妹妹 It's his sister who holds a grudge.
[28:21.81]但你还是没有选择 But still, you have no choice.
[28:24.55]以我的经验  一旦混乱演变成了万劫不复 I mean, in my experience, once the chaos tips into forever,
[28:28.25]你也会一无所获 you've got nothing.
[28:29.20]而我们离万劫不复就差一点了 And we're very close to forever.
[28:35.39]她什么都没说 And she said nothing.
[28:39.56]你真的很在意  是不是 It really bothers you, doesn't it?
[28:41.74]那些让你看不透的人 When you can't figure a person out.
[28:44.12]-尤其是你喜欢的  -天啊  你说什么呢 - Especially when you're attracted. - Oh, my God, what are you...
[28:48.80]我和克莱尔·安德伍德没有私情 I am not involved with Claire Underwood.
[28:52.73]我说的是安奈特 I'm talking about Annette.
[28:55.85]我现在和任何人都没有恋爱关系 I'm not involved with anyone at the moment.
[28:58.77]每次看见你们两个在一起  都让我想起往事 Every time I see the both of you together, it brings back memories.
[29:03.64]真没想到你也会从幕后走上前台 Never thought you'd step out from behind the scenes.
[29:06.36]只要我能为国出力就行  议员 Well, wherever I can do the most good, Congressman.
[29:09.77]他可真是一点都没变 He hasn't changed. Not at all.
[29:11.36]是好事  也是坏事 Blessing and a curse.
[29:14.15]你为我做的一切  我都没忘 I haven't forgotten everything you did for me.
[29:17.43]不管有我没我  你都成功进了众议院 Oh, you made it to the House with or without me.
[29:19.90]是你带我上的道 You showed me the way.
[29:23.36]那么 Well...
[29:25.07]我一直想来打个招呼 I've been meaning to say hello,
[29:27.38]自从你脱党加入对方之后 ever since you left the party and went to the other side.
[29:32.17]简 Jane.
[29:40.32]得有十多年没和他说话了 Haven't spoken to him in over a decade.
[29:42.10]他知道了 He knows.
[29:43.32]他知道我参与其中了 He knows I was involved.
[29:46.04]难道你没有吗 Well, weren't you?
[29:49.20]你我都有啊 Weren't we?
[29:53.47]你上次去我家是什么时候 When's the last time you were in my house?
[29:57.90]别 Don't.
[30:01.71]马克  我不会再去了 Mark, I'm not going back there.
[30:05.48]不是 No, no,
[30:06.44]和汤姆·耶茨有私情的是新任新闻发言人 Tom Yates was sleeping with the new press secretary
[30:09.02]就在白宫里 in the White House.
[30:16.12]他拿东部换西部 He traded the East for the West.
[30:19.13]是  所有近海油气开采  先生 Yes, all offshore oil and gas exploration, sir.
[30:25.13]他们说我们仍可以进入 They're saying we'll still have access,
[30:26.44]但所有通过地中海的航运都会受影响 but all shipping through the Mediterranean will be affected.
[30:28.49]而且无法否认  我们将得看他们的脸色 And there's no denying we'll be somewhat at their mercy.
[30:34.83]因为根本没时间请示您 Because there wasn't time to consult you.
[30:40.53]佩特罗夫加了码 Petrov upped the ante
[30:42.01]似乎副总统要让步了 and it looks like the vice president is going to cave.
[30:47.50]这个问题不难回答  斯图尔特小姐 It's not a complicated question, Miss Stewart.
[30:50.37]你有没有和他上床 Were you sleeping with him?
[30:54.70]难道还要我说 Do I need to say
[30:55.67]本届政府是在你身上赌了一把吗 this administration has taken a huge chance on you?
[30:58.40]-你们到底有没有  -跟你没关系 - Were you sleeping... - It is none of your business.
[31:02.29]那就不言自明了 That answers that, then.
[31:06.18]这种事正是白宫需要... This is exactly the kind of thing the White House needs...
[31:11.26]避免的 to avoid.
[31:17.00]汤姆·耶茨又失踪了 And Tom Yates is missing.
[31:20.27]只会让整件事情变得更加可疑 Which only makes the whole story more problematic.
[31:22.92]我完全不知道这些流言是哪来的 I have no idea where any of this is coming from.
[31:24.65]那我建议你否认的方式更有说服力一些 Well, I suggest you find a more convincing way of denying it.
[31:28.74]因为你最大的弱点就是不会撒谎  是不是 Because your inability to lie is a liability, right?
[31:36.72]我们的总统又在哪呢 Now, where is our president?
[31:42.88]你怎么不告诉他们是我邀请你来的呢 Why didn't you tell them I invited you?
[31:46.60]你没有出卖我 You didn't rat me out.
[31:48.11]你这口气像黑帮  总统女士 You sound like a gangster, Madam President.
[31:52.88]大概是好奇吧 Curiosity, I suppose.
[31:54.33]我想看看你怎么做 I wanted to watch you
[31:57.69]听听他们怎么说 and hear them.
[32:00.41]你的副总统主子太多 Your vice president is serving too many masters.
[32:06.57]很奇怪吧 Strange, hmm?
[32:09.52]弗兰西斯刚走  凯茜也走了 Cathy passing away so soon after Francis.
[32:12.95]俗话说  死人成三 Death usually comes in threes.
[32:16.53]直到又死了第四个  第五个 Except when it comes in fours or fives.
[32:20.47]你现在自由了吗  总统女士 Are you free now, Madam President?
[32:25.30]还没有 Not quite.
[32:28.50]他们的提案  你满意吗 Were you happy with what they proposed?
[32:30.69]我主要是好奇 Mostly, I'm just curious.
[32:33.80]好奇什么 About what?
[32:34.80]好奇你有什么提议  所以你才邀请我来吧 What you're about to offer. That is why you invited me.
[32:38.39]所以我才应邀前来 And that is why I said yes.
[32:41.34]奈克西斯安保公司 Well, Nexis Securities
[32:43.79]或任何与谢泼德无限责任公司有关的承包商 or any other contractor connected to Shepherd Unlimited
[32:48.74]在我任内都将被禁止进入叙利亚 will never be allowed in Syria while I'm president.
[32:52.53]这个手段很强硬啊 That's a strong declaration.
[32:55.50]有关投标将经过我的批准 Bids will be contingent on my approval.
[32:58.92]油气和港口可以都归你 You can have the oil and gas, the ports.
[33:01.20]以及转运资源利润的20% And 20% of profits from the resources passing through.
[33:06.30]这 That's...
[33:08.67]还真是慷慨啊 That's quite a taste.
[33:13.47]没准你真是黑帮呢 Maybe you are a gangster.
[33:16.82]那么你打算 And how will you...
[33:18.96]怎么为自己的立场辩护呢 defend your position?
[33:22.69]和平 Peace.
[33:25.98]咱们两个国家这一百年来 Isn't that what our two countries
[33:28.02]不是一直以此为借口来开脱 have used to justify what we've done
[33:29.74]我们在那个地区做的事吗 in the region for over a hundred years?
[33:31.57]和平言过其实了  克莱尔 Peace is overrated, Claire.
[33:33.29]我的副总统的承诺也是一样 So are my vice president's promises.
[33:35.37]但你的开价似乎太大方了 And yet, yours seem too generous.
[33:41.22]你丈夫肯定会被这一天的 Your husband would have lost himself
[33:43.37]荣耀冲昏了头 in the brightness of this day,
[33:47.03]被他追求的形象蒙住了眼 blinded by how he needed to be seen.
[33:50.76]这总让他代价惨重 That always cost him.
[33:53.53]容我问下 Can I ask?
[33:56.47]既然你已经知道了 If you knew this...
[34:00.51]为什么还要嫁给他 why did you marry him?
[34:04.28]你真的知道吗 Do you even know?
[34:09.10]后来才发现 As it turns out...
[34:11.36]我丈夫也只是实现目的的手段而已 my husband was a means to an end.
[34:30.84]告诉你主子  我不会作证了 Tell the people you work for that I'm not going to testify.
[34:33.31]等等 A second.
[34:35.43]赛斯 Seth.
[34:38.19]赛斯  你听见了吗 Seth, do you hear me?
[34:40.08]走开吧  道格 Back off, Doug.
[34:42.48]不管你告诉他们什么  都跟我无关 Whatever you told them, I'll have no part of it.
[34:44.99]联邦检察官可以给我发传票  她可以... The U.S. Attorney can subpoena me. She can try to...
[34:51.49]我不干了 I'm done.
[34:54.39]你真是不识好歹啊 You wouldn't know a good thing if it smacked you in the face.
[34:59.63]我都不知道我为什么要帮你 I don't know why I'm trying to help you.
[35:04.13]你已经不在白宫了  道格 You're not in the White House anymore, Doug.
[35:13.25]你去哪了 Where were you?
[35:14.56]总统也有三急的  马克 Even presidents need to pee, Mark.
[35:16.67]最近有一些流言 Look, there's a rumor flying around.
[35:18.79]-是好事吗  -很容易打消 - Was it good? - It's easily dismissible.
[35:21.38]我还和国安局谈了谈  没用的  克莱尔 Then I talked to NSA. It's not gonna work, Claire.
[35:23.72]白宫绯闻解决不了这件事的 Some White House affair is not gonna make it go away.
[35:28.23]死去的人并不会彻底死去  马克 The dead never really stay dead, Mark.
[35:31.49]他们会活在爱他们的人心中 Not for the people who loved them.
[35:47.05]-抱歉  -抱歉 - Excuse me. - Excuse me.
[35:52.32]你又长高了吗 Did you get taller?
[35:54.55]是啊 Yes.
[35:56.57]真奇怪 So strange
[35:58.17]有拿破仑情结[矮子更暴力]的人居然会长高 for someone trapped in a Napoleon complex.
[36:01.05]可惜你的个性和外表不相称  简·戴维斯 If only your personality matched your looks, Jane Davis.
[36:08.23]我实在是没想到  你居然会把谈判 I was surprised you left negotiations
[36:10.73]交给你的代理  西格森小姐 to your surrogate Ms. Siegerson.
[36:14.44]自己的意见还是自己来说比较好 Always best to speak for oneself.

[49:53.38]自特朗普在2016年大选中意外击败希拉里 成为美国史上最大的政治黑马后  希拉里所在的民主党 就一直指责特朗普团队在竞选期间 暗中勾结俄罗斯  破坏大选的公正性 特朗普2017年炒掉联调局局长科米后  司法部成立了"专案组" 任命前联调局局长穆勒为独立检察官  领导对"通俄门"指控的调查 经过一年多的调查  穆勒及其团队已经对17个人进行了正式的起诉 包括俄罗斯网络黑客  前特朗普竞选团队成员  以及前竞选组织主席 另外纽约州的司法部还对特朗普的私人律师进行了起诉 过去一年里  穆勒团队的主要策略是以轻罪起诉被调查的嫌疑人 想靠给这些人施压  来换取他们的合作 让他们供出一些特朗普的猛料来换取自身的自由
[50:53.38]同时穆勒还在争取直接询问特朗普的机会 数月来一直在同白宫特朗普的律师团商谈相关的询问具体方式和时间 而支持特朗普的一些司法评论人士一直警告特朗普不能轻易上钩 因为在接受特别检察官询问时  稍有不慎  很容易被定下个"妨碍司法"罪 当年比尔·克林顿总统同白宫实习生有染的丑闻被曝光后 并不是因为"生活问题" 而是因为接受大陪审团询问时"妨碍司法"而被弹劾 目前美国媒体认为 在11月初的中期选举之后  穆勒的调查将进入收尾阶段 届时专案组是否会对特朗普进行起诉  将会成为全球媒体关注的焦点 而既然民主党已在中期选举中夺回了众议院控制权 即使穆勒的调查结论 无法确定特朗普竞选团队是否同俄罗斯有暗中交易 民主党仍很有可能会寻找机会启动弹劾特朗普的程序
