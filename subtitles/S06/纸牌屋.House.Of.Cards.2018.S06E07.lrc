[01:26.79]痛苦分两种 There are two kinds of pain.
[01:29.96]一种让你变得更强 The sort of pain that makes you strong.
[01:33.21]另一种毫无价值 Or useless pain...
[01:35.82]只是徒添折磨 the sort of pain that's only suffering.
[01:39.23]我对没价值的东西也没耐心 I have no patience for useless things.
[01:59.21]我回头望向她 I turn around and see her,
[02:02.53]我亲爱的妻子  倚靠在前廊上 my darling wife, poised on the front stoop.
[02:06.52]她肯定都看见了 Surely she saw everything.
[02:09.30]所有的杀戮  相关的谎言  但她未置一词 The killing, the lying about it, but doesn't say a word.
[02:14.76]她只是若无其事地回到房子里 She just enters the house in quiet compliance.
[02:19.84]这就是爱 This is love.
[02:22.44]每个人都应该 Everyone should be so--

[04:35.66]我亲爱的同胞们 My beloved Americans.
[04:38.46]我现在百感交集 My heart is very full today.
[04:42.14]我今天来谈谈未来 I am here to talk about the future.
[04:45.62]未来已经变得极度私人化 And the future has become very personal.
[04:55.02]我们聚集在伟大祖国的中心 We are gathered here at the very center of our great nation
[05:01.41]来庆祝这个历史性的女性集会 to celebrate this historic Women's Conference.
[05:01.67]我们众志成城
[05:02.17]女性平等 就是人人平等
[05:06.43]这一刻对于美国人民影响深远 This is a profound moment for all Americans.
[05:23.60]但这也是危险的时刻  朋友们 But it's also a perilous time in our history, my friends.
[05:29.27]因为一些国内的寡头们 Because the American oligarchs out there,
[05:33.21]正对我们虎视眈眈 they are coming for us.
[05:35.66]他们正试图剥夺宪法赋予我的 They are trying to strip me of my constitutional power
[05:38.58]身为三军统帅的权力 as your Commander In Chief.
[05:42.13]下级法院作出了对我有利的判决 Now the lower court ruled in my favor,
[05:44.56]但他们正要把此案 but now they've taken this case
[05:46.80]上诉至最高法院 all the way to the Supreme Court.
[05:49.59]新全国女性会议
[05:49.81]他们要把我的手指从核按钮上挪开 And they want my finger off the nuclear button.
[05:53.20]我想问问 And I have to ask...
[05:55.66]你觉得他们为什么要这样 Why do you think that is?
[06:03.61]这些寡头 These oligarchs,
[06:05.28]通过一个看似无害的应用 through an innocent seeming app,
[06:07.86]正试图通过偷窥你的手机 have been trying to steal the midterms
[06:10.79]侵犯你的隐私 by crawling your phones,
[06:13.52]指挥你如何投票 invading your privacy
[06:16.48]来窃取中期选举的胜利 and telling you how to vote.
[06:19.81]那么  你会让他们为所欲为吗 Now, are you gonna let them get away with it?
[06:22.07]不 No!
[06:23.77]我们得让他们清醒过来 We need to tell them to wake up!
[06:26.04]跟着我一起说  堪萨斯州黎巴嫩的民众 Say it with me, Lebanon, Kansas.
[06:28.01]国会应该 It is time for Congress to...
[06:30.03]醒醒了 Wake up!
[06:31.72]最高法院应该 And it's time for the Supreme Court to...
[06:34.12]醒醒了 Wake up!
[06:36.38]我的目标是让美国更上一层楼 Now, my purpose is to elevate America,
[06:40.91]为她奋斗 fight for America,
[06:42.77]如果有必要的话  为她牺牲 and if it ever came to it, die for America.
[06:46.67]我会成为大家的父亲  母亲  领袖以及朋友 I will be father, mother, leader and friend.
[06:51.21]非常感谢 Thank you so much.
[07:00.45]父亲  母亲  领袖 Father, mother, leader...
[07:05.27]骗子  杀手 liar, killer.
[07:28.35]安息吧  瑞秋 Rest in peace, Rachel.
[07:43.17]这是什么时候的录像 When's the footage from?
[07:44.36]几天前的 It's from several days ago.
[07:46.11]他一直待在一个小屋里 He's been staying at a cabin.
[07:47.62]他小时候住过的地方  待了三四周 Childhood cabin for three or four weeks.
[07:49.85]我们怀疑他潜藏在洛赛瑞欧斯外的山里 We suspect he's in the mountains outside Los Cerillos now.
[07:53.01]他找到埋她尸体的地方了吗 And did he find where he buried her?
[07:54.51]我们还不确定 We're still not sure.
[07:55.73]女士  我收到一名前探员的爆料 Ma'am, I got a tip from a former agent.
[07:58.49]他曾受谢泼德兄妹指使去加夫尼打探 One of the ones poking around Gaffney on behalf of the Shepherds.
[08:01.88]道格最近联系了赛斯·格雷森 Doug recently reached out to Seth Grayson.
[08:04.44]我们知道他们谈了什么吗 Do we know what was discussed?
[08:06.80]不  但这是你上次和他谈话后 No, but it's the first time he's contacted
[08:09.00]他第一次与谢泼德家族 anyone connected with the Shepherds
[08:11.41]有关的人联络 since you last spoke to him.
[08:14.84]如果他这么想被抓的话  那就抓住他 Well, if he's trying to get caught, let's catch him.
[08:23.12]邓肯·谢泼德到底会不会去作证 So is Duncan Shepherd testifying or not?
[08:26.05]他的律师还在谈条件 His lawyers are negotiating the terms.
[08:28.14]他们希望他能不公开作证 They're hoping that he could meet behind closed doors.
[08:31.12]那他必须得被传唤 Well, then he needs to be subpoenaed.
[08:32.72]我们会见过的每个议员 Every congressperson we've spoken to
[08:34.13]-都同意如此  但是  -他们在拖延 - agrees he should be and yet-- - They're delaying.
[08:36.43]他们并不真想 I mean,?there's no real desire
[08:37.65]推动针对应用的调查 to move this app investigation along.
[08:39.52]他们想保护自己人 They're protecting their own.
[08:42.03]是众议院要求举行听证会的 The House asked for these hearings.
[08:43.81]他们需要走过场 The theatre is good for them.
[08:45.89]但我们在跟委员会的 But we are in constant contact
[08:47.55]民主党成员密切联系  女士 with the Democratic members of the committee, ma'am.
[08:49.54]给他们压力 They're feeling the pressure.
[08:50.84]显然压力还不够 Well, clearly, not enough.
[08:51.88]我们可以先逮捕几个议员 We can start arresting congresspeople.
[08:53.77]有必要的话  把他们从众议院拉出来 Pull them out of the chambers if we have to.
[08:55.69]-举行听证会的意义  -是什么  打太极吗 - The whole point of the hearings-- - Is what? Obfuscation?
[08:59.46]怎么  这可是侵犯隐私的事 What? We're talking about invasion of privacy here.
[09:02.47]联邦检察官要证据确凿才肯 The US Attorney is resistant to pressing any kind of charges
[09:05.34]-提出诉讼  -应用本身就是确凿证据 - without hard evidence. - The app is the evidence.
[09:08.91]-这就是起诉理由  诺拉  -也许吧 - This is grounds for prosecution, Nora. - Yes, maybe.
[09:11.56]但联邦检察官不会同意 But the US Attorney would argue--
[09:12.90]那就换掉联邦检察官 Replace the US Attorney.
[09:16.13]这件事她拖了好几个月了 She's been dragging her feet on this for months.
[09:19.16]女士  我们还得走正当程序 Ma'am, we still live in a world of due process.
[09:22.61]这会发出令人不安的信号 That would send a chilling message--
[09:23.67]我们需要发出保护民主的信号 The message is we need to protect our democracy.
[09:34.46]出于实际考虑  我们要取消今天的第四站行程 On a practical note, we're canceling the fourth stop today.
[09:39.38]我们斟酌后觉得去了克利夫兰就不用去托莱多了 Upon reflection, we decided Toledo would be redundant with Cleveland.
[09:43.56]帕姆  没事  不妨直说 Pam, it's fine. You can be honest.
[09:46.54]三军统帅 The Commander In Chief
[09:47.76]今天有些迷糊而已 is feeling a little woozy today. That's all.
[09:51.82]而且还有点暴躁  但没什么的  真的 And yes, maybe a little cranky, but nothing serious. I promise.
[09:58.36]我们一到得梅因 When we touch down in Des Moines,
[10:00.36]诺拉  你就可以直接回华府了 Nora, you can head straight back to DC.
[10:16.19]斯克斯基  你是斯拉夫人吗 Is it Slavic, "Skorsky"?
[10:20.60]我是波兰裔 Polish, in my case.
[10:23.69]你很孤独吧 You must be lonely.
[10:27.72]我让记者团乘第二架飞机 I asked the press corps to take the second plane,
[10:30.70]我们就好私下见面 so that you and I could meet privately.
[10:35.16]四个月前  你见了两个人 Four months ago, you met with two people.
[10:39.13]现在一个人失踪了  一个人死了 One of them's missing and one of them is dead.
[10:44.06]我最近总是遇到不幸 My life has certainly been punctuated with loss lately.
[10:48.67]但也有运气 And just a bit of great luck.
[10:50.76]但汤姆·汉默施密特就不走运了 Tom Hammerschmidt was not lucky.
[10:53.31]没错  确实很悲惨 No, he wasn't. That was tragic.
[10:57.15]所以我觉得你该继承他的衣钵 That's why I think you should pick up his mantle.
[11:00.40]完整地讲述弗兰西斯的政治生涯 And tell the full story of Francis' political career.
[11:03.40]你在逗我吗 Are you messing with me?
[11:04.96]不  我说真的 No. Far from it.
[11:06.76]你调查并曝光了谢泼德自由基金会 You did a great job investigating and exposing
[11:09.21]应用的事  这非常出色 the Shepherd Freedom Foundation app.
[11:12.26]曝光其非法用途 Its nefarious uses.
[11:15.49]我们不能让议员逍遥法外 We can't let congresspeople get away with things like that.
[11:19.63]我怀疑最高法院废了你之前 I wonder if you'll get them in line
[11:21.73]你能不能控制住他们 before the Supreme Court takes your power away.
[11:27.05]我和汤姆·汉默施密特最后一次谈话时 Tom Hammerschmidt and I, the last time we spoke,
[11:29.20]谈到了我丈夫 we talked about my husband.
[11:30.76]我希望可以跟你说完 And my hope is I could pick it up with you.
[11:34.76]我有很多关于弗兰西斯的事要说 I have a lot that needs to be said about Francis,
[11:36.66]他大大小小的罪过 his crimes and misdemeanors.
[11:41.18]你想不想听我说 You want my story or don't you?
[11:48.86]又是轻微宫缩 Oh, it's these mini contractions.
[11:50.22]这叫希克斯假阵缩 They're, um... called Braxton Hicks.
[11:54.65]你有孩子吗 Do you have kids?
[11:56.33]没有 No, I don't.
[11:59.75]这胎儿动静真大 Oh, the baby's really moving now.
[12:02.62]宝宝在踢  你想摸摸看吗 It's kicking. Do you want to feel?
[12:04.39]不用了  谢谢 No, thank you.
[12:06.79]这感觉真奇妙 Such a strange feeling.
[12:12.49]要对另一个生命负责 To be wholly responsible for the life of another.
[12:17.14]我还听说  等你有了孩子 Also, I hear, when you have kids, you never...
[12:20.58]就没法像以前一样睡觉了 sleep quite the same again.
[12:25.48]痛苦分两种 There are two kinds of pain.
[12:31.86]道格·斯坦普给我发了条信息 Doug Stamper sent me that text,
[12:36.12]他说这是你丈夫日记里的话 he said it comes from your husband's diary.
[12:40.59]我要问你 Now, I ask you,
[12:44.58]我该采访你  还是他 who should I interview, you or him?
[12:52.14]我知道你们有些人过来 I know that some of you are here
[12:53.45]是因为不确定 because you're not sure?
[12:54.42]明年的聚会我是否还会健在 I'm gonna be around at next year's gathering.
[12:57.05]没事  我从你们的表情里 Oh, no, no, I can see it on--
[12:59.45]看得出  没错 On your faces. And it's true.
[13:02.12]过去几个月  我反思了一下 These last few months, I've had to look back.
[13:07.66]但我很兴奋  真的 But I'm excited. I am.
[13:11.75]正如我妹妹所言 As my sister told you,
[13:14.02]这个国家接下来几个月会迎来改变 there are changes coming to this country in the next few months.
[13:19.19]我为之努力了20多年 The kind that I haven't been able to accomplish
[13:21.64]依然没有实现 in the 20 plus years that I've been at it.
[13:25.44]为人们去监管  给每个人一个机会 It'll cut regulation for the people, give every man a chance.
[13:29.07]你授人以渔 You lead a man to fish, and he--
[13:32.19]却可能为此身陷囹圄  那就来吧 You want to lock me up in prison for that, then so be it, but...
[13:37.10]还冻结我的资产 Seize my assets.
[13:43.28]你们知道吗 Did you read...
[13:48.09]雀鸟也做梦 finches dream?
[13:55.08]是啊 Yeah, yeah.
[13:57.02]它们可以 They can-- They have the--
[13:59.51]它们可以在入睡时为自己歌唱 They can sing to themselves when they sleep.
[14:04.23]我说到哪儿了 Where was I?
[14:04.78]我这边有些议员想要退出 I have congressmen who want to break away.
[14:07.63]从这件事里脱身 Separate themselves from this.
[14:10.78]见风使舵嘛 Well, deflect and compliment.
[14:13.15]这就是我在国会时的生存之道 That's how I survived the Hill.
[14:18.68]这些听证会会让我们完蛋的  马克 These hearings will blow up on us, Mark.
[14:21.75]不管怎样  我们都用过那个破应用 Now, one way or another, we all used that motherfucking app.
[14:27.34]他们确实对我们不错 And yes, they've been good to us, but...
[14:30.58]但是我们凭什么要为那小子犯的错买单 why do we all have to pay for what the son set in motion?
[14:34.80]你对邓肯有意见 Anything you want to say about Duncan,
[14:36.24]跟安奈特说去 you say it to Annette.
[14:37.31]我在请求你去说 Well, I'm asking you to say it.
[14:43.37]时隔这么多年  真不敢相信 I can't believe I'm looking to you
[14:44.73]我又再次向你求助 for help again all these years later.
[14:50.38]你曾是副总统 You were vice president.
[14:55.56]我东山再起了至少三次  布雷特 I've rebuilt my career at least three times, Brett.
[14:59.26]有必要的话我还能卷土重来 And I will continue to do so as long as I have to.
[15:04.48]可惜简·戴维斯没这个机会了 Too bad Jane Davis won't have that chance.
[15:08.86]"我在克莱尔和佐伊面前是不同的人" "What I am to Claire is not what I am to Zoe."
[15:12.64]你明白这句话的意思吗 Do you know what it means?
[15:14.81]他觉得你能明白吗 Does he believe you should know what it means?
[15:16.94]是的  他补充道  "这是他留给我的" Yes. He added, "And that's what he left me..."
[15:21.91]这是弗兰西斯日记上的话 It belongs to some diary that Francis kept.
[15:24.41]但不是来自他的总统文件吗 But not part of his presidential papers?
[15:26.07]不管是什么  安德伍德总统 Whatever it is, it's information that President Underwood--
[15:29.46]黑尔总统都不希望它曝光 President Hale wants kept out of the light.
[15:32.93]道格暗示她为了 Doug implied that she got pregnant
[15:36.11]夺去本属于他的东西而怀上孕 so as to keep him from what was rightfully his.
[15:39.30]你接下来什么时候能跟他通话 When will you speak with him next?
[15:40.60]我猜是他下次找到公用电话或是一次性手机的时候 My guess is the next time he finds a payphone or a burner.
[15:44.51]我要见他 I'd like to meet with him.
[15:55.03]-安奈特  -你会出名的  布雷特 - Annette. - You're going to be famous, Brett.
[15:57.73]出名也分美名远扬 Well, there's fame...
[16:00.87]和臭名昭着 and then there's notoriety.
[16:02.43]你几个月前签署的法案 The bill you had your name on all those months ago...
[16:06.22]会得到最高法院的支持 will be upheld in the Supreme Court.
[16:08.83]这是阿布鲁佐法官的多数判决 This is Judge Abruzzo's majority ruling.
[16:13.47]-你怎么...  -是我们帮他写的 - How did you-- - We helped him write it.
[16:17.19]这个判决措辞犀利 It's worded in such a way
[16:18.42]她的权力将会被慢慢地 that her powers will be diminished...
[16:21.91]全部瓦解掉 over time and across the board.
[16:26.08]马克告诉你我们的计划了吗 Mark gave you a sense of what we're thinking?
[16:28.05]说了一点 A bit.
[16:29.21]你只需要拖延这些听证会 You just need to run out the clock on these hearings.
[16:32.00]中期选举之后  你就可以强势出手了 After the midterms, you can send a powerful message.
[16:38.70]这些年我们有幸 Over the years, we've been lucky enough
[16:40.15]扶持了一批富有才华 to support an array of talented
[16:43.10]与我们志同道合的政治家 and like-minded politicians.
[16:45.15]我们就像第三党一样 We've essentially operated like a third party.
[16:48.63]总有一天 And one day,
[16:49.67]在不远的将来  我们会正式成立党派 in the not too distant future, we'll make it official.
[16:53.96]布雷特  你将成为党的领袖 Brett, you will be the leader of that party.
[16:57.12]你会入主白宫 You'll be our man in the White House.
[17:00.18]我向布雷特表达了我们 I told Brett how thankful we are
[17:02.84]对于他让邓肯免受媒体关注的谢意 for keeping Duncan out of the spotlight.
[17:06.38]我不会忘记你为他做的事 I won't forget all you've done for him.
[17:09.77]事实上  那是个很好的问题  鲍勃 Well, that's actually a very good question, Bob.
[17:11.63]我们国家在世界上排名如何 Where do we rank as a country in the world?
[17:14.80]如果你非要问的话  我们排第17 You have to ask that. We're 17.
[17:17.31]这就是我们  第17 That's where we are. 17th.
[17:20.04]-这简直是耻辱  -说到耻辱 - That is a disgrace-- - Speaking of disgrace,
[17:23.02]我有个问题问你  先生 I have a question for you, sir.
[17:25.40]你生病是因为你家族的 Did your family make you sick
[17:27.59]化学工厂和有毒地区吗 with their chemical plants and their toxic sites?
[17:29.81]把她带出去 Get her out of here.
[17:31.39]你是自作自受 You made yourself sick.
[17:33.15]你会害死我们所有人 And you're killing all of us.
[17:34.30]-来人把这位小姐带出去  -当然了 - Somebody take care of this young lady. - Of course
[17:35.53]他要赶我出去  你正在害死我们所有人 he's going to take me out. He is. You're killing all of us.
[17:42.80]"我不打算说假话  我讨厌小孩 "I'm not gonna lie, I despise children.
[17:45.30]我就这么说了" There, I've said it."
[17:47.06]你搞什么鬼 What the hell is wrong with you?
[17:48.76]"30分钟前  佐伊给我发了条短信 "Thirty minutes ago I received a text from Zoe.
[17:50.81]毫无疑问  她想道歉" She intends to apologize, no doubt."
[17:52.49]等等  等等  这话是哪来的 Wait, wait, what's that from?
[17:54.13]我不是在说吗 That's what I'm saying.
[17:56.70]道格  来我这里  我们见一面 Doug, come here. Let's meet.
[17:59.06]"谁都不听话 "Rebellion on all fronts--"
[18:00.68]克莱尔  佐伊  罗素  我不能失去决心" "Claire, Zoe, Russo. I must not lose my resolve."
[18:04.41]别说了  你在哪 Hey, stop. Where are you?
[18:06.22]不  不  不  那是行不通的 No, no, no. That's not how this is gonna work.
[18:11.62]道格  我们能找到你 Doug, we can find you.
[18:14.34]用不了多久 It won't take very long.
[18:15.55]我现在就告诉你我在哪 I'll tell you where I am right now.
[18:18.14]就在一个鸟不拉屎的地方 Right in the middle of nowhere.
[18:20.21]我五分钟后就会离开这里  我要受不了了 I'm five minutes from out of here and out of fucking mind.
[18:23.20]她只是想和你坐下谈谈 She just wants to sit with you.
[18:24.94]我会告诉你我想让什么被说出来和怎么说 I'm going to tell you what I want said and how.
[18:29.90]他们有律师  有钱  我没有 They have the lawyers, the money. I don't.
[18:32.91]他们按我说的做 They do what I tell them,
[18:35.36]那我们就可以见面 then I know we can meet.
[18:37.06]你的要求都会得到满足的  我保证 You will get everything that you are due. I'll make sure of it.
[18:43.34]你什么时候再联系我 When will I hear from you again?
[18:58.41]抱歉他们把你叫到飞机上来  拉森医生 I'm so sorry that they called you onto the plane, Dr. Larson.
[19:01.13]我现在感觉好多了 I feel fine now.
[19:02.71]但是依你现在的情况 All the same, you're getting close to a time
[19:04.60]对你和孩子来说  飞来飞去可不是很好 where jumping on and off a plane may not be the best idea.
[19:07.65]你说你觉得很累 You said you'd been feeling run down.
[19:10.05]是的  有点  但... Yes, a little bit. But--
[19:11.11]我认为我们应该回华府 I think we should get you back to DC
[19:12.98]验一下血  以防万一 to do some blood work as a precaution.
[19:14.96]好  可以 Okay, that's fine.
[19:17.11]但如果没有威胁到孩子的安全 But unless I'm putting the baby in danger,
[19:20.86]我今天还得再去两个地方 I've got two more appearances today.
[19:22.97]我建议你不要这么做 I'd advise against that.
[19:26.61]我不能做请病假的总统  拉森医生 I cannot be the indisposed president, Dr. Larson.
[19:29.47]我相信你没什么问题 I'm sure you're fine,
[19:30.59]但是你的化验结果显示你有点脱水 but your sample tells me you're a bit dehydrated.

[50:50.68]我当然没想过会以遗孀的身份生下弗兰西斯的孩子 I didn't expect to deliver Francis' child as a widow, of course.

[51:14.06]娘家姓[少女名] Maiden name.
[51:16.24]这种称呼的背后含义 The assumptions behind that expression
[51:19.14]让我回归了我的本名 led me back to what I can only call my name.
[51:24.18]黑尔总统 President Hale,
[51:26.46]为什么副总统空缺 why the delay in nominating a replacement
[51:29.32]迟迟不做提名 for the vice presidential vacancy?
[51:31.64]有两个原因  其一  是因为宪法 Two reasons. One, constitutionally,
[51:34.29]要求国会确认人选 Congress needs to confirm the choice
[51:36.41]但现在  国会乌烟瘴气 and our current Congress is dirty.
[51:41.68]我们得看中期选举的结果 We'll have to see what happens with the midterms.
[51:44.11]其二  要说我从搭档关系中学到了什么 And two, if I've learned anything from partnerships,
[51:49.24]你必须选一个甘愿为你挡子弹的人 you have to choose someone who'd take a bullet for you.

[52:07.19]连我自己都未必真了解他 I'm not sure I ever really knew him myself.
[52:12.68]我知道你也看出来了 I know you saw it, too.
[52:14.88]他无法被看透  就跟其他骗子一样 He was impossible to know, like all con men.
[52:19.13]他把我们都耍了 He played us all.

[54:04.64]"核武橄榄球"可追溯到冷战时期  在核战争一触即发的形势下 美国总统出行时开始携带可以下令发动核武攻击的"核按钮" 但其实  "橄榄球"是一个标准的Zero Halliburton牌铝制保险箱 外套一个黑皮公文包 箱内主要物品是总统考虑发动核打击时的打击方案  启动警报的程序 以及最重要的  一个印有密码的塑料卡片  用来验证总统身份 这个卡片被叫做"饼干" 利用包内的物品  美国总统可以同五角大楼的指挥中心联系 在验证身份后  下令实施核打击 总统出行时  "橄榄球"由一名经过最严格背景调查的武官携带保管 这名武官被要求必须时刻紧跟总统左右  但也会有意外情况发生 里根总统遇刺后  被专车迅速送往医院进行紧急手术 而携带"橄榄球"的武官却没有立刻随车前往 事后人们还发现  里根当时把带有验证码的"饼干"放在了自己的袜子里 而手术期间这个可以发动核战争的塑料卡片被护士丢在了医院的地板上
[55:04.64]在美国的媒体江湖中  绝大部分的主流媒体 如《纽约时报》《华盛顿邮报》《时代周刊》 NBC  CBS  ABC三大电视网  CNN  MSNBC等有线新闻台 都在意识形态上不同程度左倾  偏向民主党  对民主党政客也呵护有加 只有《华尔街日报》和福克斯新闻网是共和党的盟友 但正因为右派媒体少  所以支持共和党的民众都集中在这两家媒体 再加上经营有方  福克斯新闻和《华尔街日报》都在同行竞争中占优势 而这两家媒体的老板是同一个人  新闻集团的主席默多克 在巨大的受众群体的支持下  这两家媒体在政治舆论战中举足轻重 默多克家族在美国政坛自然也影响巨大  呼风唤雨 奥巴马执政期间  福克斯新闻对民主党政府一直苛责不断 而特朗普上台后  福克斯新闻则成了新政府最好的朋友 特朗普在竞选期间  就经常找默多克商量竞选事宜 搬入白宫后  也经常给默多克打电话咨询政务  还常边看福克斯新闻边发推特 以至于全美国关心政治的媒体公众也跟着成了福克斯新闻的观众 福克斯的一些主持人在默多克的默许下  成为特朗普的亲密战友 在节目中夸赞新政府的丰功伟绩  攻击起特朗普的政敌则毫不留情
