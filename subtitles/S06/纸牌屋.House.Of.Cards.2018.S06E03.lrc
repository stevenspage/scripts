[50:38.23]你已经没有选择了  总统女士 You've run out of options, Madam President.
[50:43.74]我知道了 I understand.
[50:50.97]美国最高法院设有九名大法官  往往其中八人在意识形态上左右各半 而总有一名在断案时忽左忽右  成为决定案情的最关键一票 今年夏天"摇摆票"肯尼迪法官宣布退休 特朗普提名布雷特·卡瓦诺接替肯尼迪的席位 因为卡瓦诺是保守派  一旦他成功任命  最高法院势必整体右倾 在参议院举行的任命听证过程中  反对党民主党议员们虽然百般努力 但是因席位不够  所以无力阻挡卡瓦诺进军最高法院的脚步 然而9月16日  《华盛顿邮报》刊文  报道加州一名大学教授 克里斯汀·福特称高中时在一次聚会上曾遭到卡瓦诺性侵未遂 虽然卡瓦诺立即发表声明断然否认性侵指控 但民主党迅速抓住机会要求白宫撤换卡瓦诺 媒体则如同打了兴奋剂一样全天候轰炸式地对性侵指控进行报道 9月27日  参议院召开公开听证会 福特首先出场  虽然对于那次聚会的很多细节都回忆不起来 但她表示自己"百分百"确定卡瓦诺就是当年的施暴者 福特发言时表情真挚  回答讯问从容镇定  谈及性侵事件  声音颤抖 几个小时下来  观者无不动容  社交网络上舆论几乎一面倒地同情福特
[51:40.96]但卡瓦诺靠听证会下半场的"激情自辩"扳回了局面 他在开场陈词中不仅坚决否认自己是施暴者 还控诉民主党议员利用福特给自己栽上莫须有的罪名 在谈及此事对自己的家庭带来的巨大伤害时  声音哽咽几难成言 在问答环节  卡瓦诺对民主党议员们的严厉质询 给予了毫不客气的反驳  甚至进行反问  舆论的天平就这样被扳了回来 10月6日下午  参议院以50比48的表决结果正式确认了卡瓦诺的大法官任命 一名共和党投了反对票  一名民主党投了赞成票  其余议员都是按党站队 卡瓦诺成为1881年以来任命投票时结果最为接近的一名大法官 而卡瓦诺的激情自辩让共和党支持者认为 他受到了民主党和媒体的双重政治迫害 这种情绪被共和党政客们转化为了催票利器 卡瓦诺正式任命后  多个民调显示共和党选民投票热情大幅提升 在11月6日的中期选举中  那些投票反对卡瓦诺任命的民主党参议员纷纷落马 唯一投票支持任命卡瓦诺的民主党参议员曼钦则顺利连任
[52:30.96]美国的各类工会组织实力强大  在同民主党结成政治同盟之后 同民主党政客互相扶持  在政客竞选时出钱出力出人 而政客上台后则会通过一系列对工会有利的法律法规 多年以来  由于影响力巨大  加上又有政治保护伞 所以很多大工会组织内部腐败不断  不少甚至成为准黑帮组织 涉及敲诈勒索  偷窃洗钱  非法赌博等等违法勾当 而挪用盗用工会成员的养老金也是被媒体揭露出来的工会黑幕之一 据报道  美国最大的一家工会成员养老金基金 因经营不善  曾经申请破产  涉及金额超过百亿美元 在芝加哥地区  当地最大的工会组织头目科力及其整个家族 控制工会多年  同芝加哥地区的各路政客也都称兄道弟
