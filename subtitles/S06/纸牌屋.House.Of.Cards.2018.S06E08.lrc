[16:21.97]各位啊 Oh, you guys.
[16:23.68]我其实真不希望还得这么做的  但是... I really didn't wanna have to have to do this, but...
[16:28.40]哈里发国恐怖组织的一个极端派系 An extreme faction of the ICO terrorist group
[16:31.68]企图在巴基斯坦购买一个核装置 made an attempt to purchase a nuclear device in Pakistan.
[16:35.60]这是事实 That's a fact.
[16:37.14]-总统女士  无意冒犯  -玛莉娅 - Madam President, all due respect-- - Maria,
[16:39.44]我知道你是新来的 I know you're new to this,
[16:40.49]但请再不要对我用那个俗语了 but please don't ever use that expression with me.
[16:43.26]"无意冒犯"表达的是完全相反的意思 "All due respect" means precisely the opposite.
[16:46.02]女士  这个威胁 Ma'am, it's just that this threat
[16:47.75]仍是一个潜在威胁 remains squarely in the category of a potential--
[16:50.73]但他们有意图 The intent is there.
[16:52.27]除非我们能确认交易... Until we have confirmation that the deal has--
[16:54.10]我们的情报机构已经表示 Our intelligence has told us
[16:55.65]他们会重新部署  再次尝试的 that they will regroup and try again.
[16:58.36]这能追溯到拉菲克·纳泽两个月前的警告 This goes back to the warning from Rafiq Nasser two months ago.
[17:02.14]自从南茜接替了诺拉 Now acting Secretary Gallagher and I
[17:04.08]成为代理国土安全部部长 have been keeping a close watch on this threat
[17:05.92]我们就一直在密切关注这一威胁 ever since Nancy took over for Nora at Homeland.
[17:09.43]为了秉承本届政府的 And in the spirit of the full transparency
[17:11.52]公开透明政策 this administration is embracing,
[17:13.74]我们要把这公诸于众 we're going to take it public.
[17:16.21]女士  老实说  我担心 Ma'am. Frankly, I'm concerned.
[17:19.74]从战略角度讲 From a strategic perspective,
[17:21.62]如果哈里发国不行动  我们就成了狼来了 if ICO doesn't act, we appear to be crying wolf.
[17:26.03]另一方面  我们要把局面搞成 But on the other hand, are we putting ourselves in a position
[17:28.34]刺激他们行动吗 where we're daring them to act?
[17:31.97]我们不想鲁莽行事 We don't want to appear reckless.
[17:38.26]我昨晚睡不着 I couldn't sleep last night.
[17:41.66]当然是因为国家安全的原因 For obvious national security reasons, of course,
[17:44.82]但是 but...
[17:46.38]也因为胎儿闹得我睡不着 also because the baby kept me awake.
[17:49.72]不知怎么 And for some reason...
[17:52.72]我想到了"厌女者"一词 the word "misogynist" popped into my mind.
[17:55.74]我努力去想有没有个对应词 And I was trying to think of the word for the opposite.
[17:58.65]就是讨厌男人的专有名词 You know, the word for when a person?hates men.
[18:02.26]在场有谁知道那个词是什么吗 Does anyone around this table know that word is?
[18:05.34]就是讨厌男人的专有名词 The word for when a person hates men?
[18:07.98]有人知道吗 Anybody?
[18:12.02]我还去查了一下 I had to go and look it up.
[18:14.35]"厌男者" "Misandrist."
[18:16.90]但没人知道这个词 And no one really knows that word
[18:18.94]因为我们文化中不常用它 because it's not used in our culture.
[18:21.54]所以我想说的是  或许我们都 So what I'm getting at, is maybe we all,
[18:24.52]不管我们什么性别 regardless of our gender,
[18:26.62]应该好好审视一下我们关于谁能 would do well to examine the pre-conceived notions that we have

[29:23.73]可能吧 Could be.
[29:27.82]什么时候变成这样的 When did it happen?
[29:30.83]我们成了拼命补救的一方 That we were the ones catching up.
[29:36.15]是我们没留神吗 Were we not paying attention?
[29:39.52]不够留神 Not enough.
[29:41.97]弗兰西斯就是个混蛋 Francis was a son of a bitch.
[29:46.78]但他是个厉害的混蛋 But he was a talented son of a bitch.

[33:11.38]唯一的问题是  道格 The only question, Doug, is
[33:13.31]如果你是他们的A计划  那他们的B计划是什么 if you're their plan A, what's their plan B?
[33:16.61]如果弗兰西斯还在  我们就能知道 If Francis were here, we'd know.
[33:18.59]是啊  如果他准备杀我 Yes. Well, if he was going to kill me,
[33:20.28]-他会怎么做  -他会利用你提供的机会 - how would he do it? - He'd find an opportunity you provided.

[34:03.01]我有时候也想  但... I do too, sometimes, but--
[34:04.84]里德想要的太多 Reed wanted too much.
[34:07.24]弗兰西斯允许我保持饥饿 Francis gave me permission to hunger.
[34:10.26]因为他也是这样 Because he felt it himself.
[34:12.42]一直都不满足 All the time. Insatiable.
[34:15.13]大家都觉得我应该知足了 Everyone thinks I should feel sated.
[34:17.07]而他说  "不  克莱尔 Then he said, "No, Claire,
[34:19.32]和我一样饥饿  永不满足" be as hungry as me."
[34:21.33]于是我吞噬了他 And so I ate him?
