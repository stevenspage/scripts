[24:40.01]-你太心不在焉了  纳森  -什么 - You sound very distracted, Nathan. - Excuse me?

[28:26.32]话说 Listen,
[28:28.07]也许不关我事 it may be none of my business,
[28:29.57]但自从邓肯收到了一个白宫寄来的包裹 but I haven't been able to reach Duncan
[28:33.29]我就再也联系不到他了 since he received a package from the White House.
[28:35.58]我不知道包裹里是什么 I don't know what it was.

[28:40.17]谢谢 Thank you.
[28:42.88]你说得对 You're right.

[29:24.25]曾经有个迷茫的年轻女孩 There was a troubled young woman...

[29:28.76]我知道  我也不喜欢这个故事 I know. I know. I hate this story.
[29:32.14]我也不想告诉你 I hate that I'm telling you.
[29:34.05]牺牲品女孩的故事我也讲腻了 I'm tired of the disposable girl story.
[29:38.52]布雷特·科尔第一次竞选时她来做志工 She started as a volunteer on Brett Cole's first campaign.
[29:41.56]马克和我是顾问 Mark and I were consulting.
[29:43.56]布雷特的妻子那时都快临盆了 Brett's wife was as pregnant as could be.
[29:46.82]而这个迷茫的姑娘却非要缠着他不放 And the troubled young woman wouldn't leave him alone.
[29:51.11]至少布雷特是这么说的 Well, that's how Brett characterized it.
[29:54.91]他有没有试图吸引她 Did he encourage her attention?
[29:57.62]享受她的迷恋 Enjoy it?
[29:59.54]那是自然的 You bet he did.
[30:01.62]他是个男人  有男人的自大 He's a man with a man's ego.
[30:05.34]总之最后出了大乱子 Anyway, of course it became a mess
[30:07.80]就像这类故事一惯的那样 in all the ways these stories do.
[30:10.30]于是收拾局面就成了马克的任务 And suddenly, it was Mark's job to clean it up.
[30:16.26]他逼她逼得太紧 He leaned on her too hard.
[30:21.56]纠缠她  羞辱她 Badgered and berated her.
[30:25.02]"你要毁了布雷特的未来 "You're ruining Brett's future.
[30:27.69]你就该消失" You better disappear."
[30:30.44]于是她就消失了 And so she did.
[30:36.53]她从罗斯福大桥上跳下去了 She jumped off the Roosevelt Bridge.
[30:40.54]这事把马克彻底吓坏了  克莱尔 It fucked with Mark's head, Claire.
[30:44.33]从此他就吓破了胆  他 He lost his nerve after that. He...
[30:46.84]他开始对一切都充满怀疑 He started to question everything.
[30:50.55]一切 Everything.

[35:54.69]汤姆  你必须满足  不然我立马就走 Tom, it has to be enough, or I walk away.
[35:59.31]-不  必须有人负责  -天啊  他都死了 - No. Someone has to answer... - Jesus Christ, he's dead.
[36:04.90]但是她 But her...
[36:07.07]你自己也说过  她和他一样有罪 You said it yourself, she's as guilty as he is.
[36:09.07]要我说甚至她罪更重 I'm saying, maybe more.
[36:11.66]也许他这么做都是为了她 Maybe he did it all for her.
[36:13.33]你知道什么 What d'you got?
[36:15.62]我们达成协议了吗 Do we have an agreement?
[36:18.04]我告诉你真相  你别把他牵涉进来 I give you the truth, and you leave him out of it.
[36:20.84]我做不到 I can't do that.
[36:26.43]这个世界本就不公平  汤姆 It's not a just world, Tom.
[36:30.47]但有时你会有机会让有罪之人受到惩罚 But sometimes you have the chance to make the right person pay,
[36:33.18]哪怕罪名对不上 even if it's for the wrong crime.
[36:37.19]难道你还不满足吗 Is that enough for you?
[36:39.35]因为如果是这样  那我尊重你的想法 Because if it's not, I respect you,
[36:40.57]但我们就此别过 and we can say goodbye.
[36:41.65]-不行  道格  我无法满足  -汤姆 - No, Doug. It's not enough for me. - Tom.
[36:43.90]-而且我也绝不同意  -汤姆 - And I do not agree! - Tom.
[36:46.45]我永远不会告诉你 I am never going to tell you
[36:48.45]就是弗兰西斯杀了这三个人 that Francis killed the three of them,
[36:50.87]佐伊  罗素 Zoe, Russo
[36:53.66]还有莉安 and LeAnn.
[36:55.33]但你已经知道真相了 But you already know the truth.
[36:59.50]是 Yes.
[37:04.30]我确实知道 Yes, I do.
[37:12.93]开始记录 On the record.
[37:16.18]从现在开始 From here.
[37:21.31]她做了什么 What did she do?
[37:24.52]斯克斯基女士 Ms. Skorsky.
[37:25.65]联邦检察官网络专案组的人很快就到了 Members of the US Attorney Cyber Task Force are on their way.
[37:28.74]我这是在给你机会 I'm giving you a chance.
[37:29.57]那我也给你个机会公开回应下吧 And I'm giving you a chance to go on the record.
[37:34.83]任何阿卡斯精炼厂或谢泼德无限责任公司旗下 Emails or any correspondence written while at Arcas Refinery
[37:38.62]子公司所发出的电邮或其他通信 or any subsidiary of Shepherd Unlimited
[37:40.75]均为比尔和安奈特·谢泼德的专有财产 are the sole property of Bill and Annette Shepherd.
[37:43.59]那么比尔和安奈特·谢泼德是否知晓 Were Bill and Annette Shepherd aware of the possibility
[37:47.09]阿卡斯厂的工人存在死亡的可能 that workers might die at the Arcas plant?
[37:50.51]别拿这玩意指着我 Get that outta my face.
[37:52.34]我们知道雷·麦耶斯给你发了什么 We know what Ray Meyers sent you.
[37:55.14]你有没有利用阿卡斯泄漏事件 Did you use the Arcas accident
[37:57.72]怂恿贝尔波特居民注册一款应用 to get the citizens of Bellport to sign up for this app?
[38:01.19]你协助谢泼德自由基金 An app that you helped develop
[38:03.48]开发出来的应用 for the Shepherd Freedom Foundation?
[38:06.02]斯克斯基女士 Ms. Skorsky,
[38:07.99]他们会没收你的电脑和其他设备的 they're about to confiscate your computer and any devices.
[38:11.41]你现在就可以拿走 You can take it right now.
[38:15.58]你什么都不会找到的 You're not gonna find anything here.
[38:19.41]我知道你要来  格雷森先生 I knew you were coming, Mr. Grayson.
[38:29.63]道格 Doug.
[38:35.68]我可以去见总统了 I'm ready to see the President.
[38:39.85]按说一个人应该始终如一 You expect a person to be true to his character.
[38:42.81]你是那么小心谨慎 You're so careful.
[38:43.69]那么擅长清理自己留下的乱子 You're so good about cleaning up after yourself.
[38:46.69]为什么没有处理掉他呢 Why didn't you just get rid of him?
[38:50.44]弗兰西斯另有想法 Well, Francis wanted it otherwise.
[38:54.91]我真希望你的答案能让我意外 I was so hoping you'd surprise me.
[38:59.20]你打算怎么做  马克 What are you gonna do, Mark?
[39:01.12]难道你要拉出尸体 You gonna pull out the body,
[39:02.58]放到墓碑上展示吗 drape it over the tombstone?
[39:05.00]胡蔓藤可是俄罗斯情报部门常用的毒药 Gelsemium is known to be used by Russian intelligence.
[39:08.21]我要你离开我家 I want you out of my house.
[39:09.71]但据我所知  你本来就是一个杀人犯 But from what I understand, you're pretty much a murderer anyway.
[39:13.55]你一般不犯错误  是不是 You don't normally make mistakes, do you?
[39:16.26]但只要犯错 But when you do,
[39:18.10]就犯个大错 they are something.
[39:19.64]难道你内心里就没希望 Was there some hope in you that
[39:21.06]那个迷茫的姑娘会自我了结吗 the troubled young woman would do herself in?
[39:24.23]这样科尔议员就能解脱了 That Congressman Cole would be relieved somehow.
[39:26.90]我要求你立即离开我家  克莱尔 I'd like you to get out of my house, Claire.
[39:36.87]你必须要井井有条  毫不留情 It's important to be organized and ruthless.
[39:40.41]我一直说事物要分成三种 Three piles, I always say.
[39:42.70]你想留着的 The stuff you wanna keep.
[39:44.50]先存起来以备后用的 The stuff you might need later that you put in storage.
[39:47.54]以及那些必须毁掉的 And the stuff you have to destroy.
[40:01.89]-简  是我  -太对不起了 - Jane, it's me. - I'm so sorry.
[40:06.10]我不介意你告诉她了 I don't care that you told her.
[40:08.52]你听见了吗  我真的不在乎 You hear me? I don't care.
[40:11.69]我的偏头痛 I have the worst migraine
[40:15.63]简直要疼死了 of my life.
[40:17.74]简 Jane.
[40:19.74]简  你还好吗 Jane, are you okay?
[40:30.79]你还好吗 Are you okay?
[40:32.84]简 Jane.
[40:45.56]我差点忘了  还有第四种呢 I almost forgot. There's always a fourth pile.
[40:48.94]那些你不知道该怎么处理的 The stuff you don't know what to do with.
[40:51.44]您要喝点水吗 Can I get you some water?
[40:53.65]或者别的什么更烈的 Something stronger, maybe?
[40:55.74]不了  谢谢  你自己随意 No, thank you. But don't let me stop you.
[40:58.86]我每年的劳工节都要禁一个月的酒 I take a month off drinking, come every Labor Day.
[41:02.33]算是某种校历仪式吧 Kind of an academic calendar ritual
[41:05.37]向自己证明我并不酗酒 to prove to myself I'm not actually an alcoholic.
[41:09.37]其实我也在节制 I'm actually abstaining myself, at the moment.
[41:14.17]是为了 For pursuit of...
[41:17.05]看得更清楚吧 clarity, I guess.
[41:21.85]想坐坐吗 Would you like to sit down?
[41:25.14]好的 Sure.
[41:33.82]他疯了 He's crazy.
[41:35.86]这是有医生证明的  你知道吧 Certifiable. You know that, right?
[41:39.86]道格仅仅一个半月之前 Doug got out of a psychiatric facility
[41:43.12]才从精神病院出来 all of a month and a half ago.
[41:44.99]无论他多么努力地想复活自己的政治生涯 And no matter how hard he tries to revive his political career
[41:47.95]想重新下场 or get back in the game...
[41:50.79]他都是个脑筋错乱的骗子 He's a delusional liar.
[41:54.34]而且实话告诉你 And to tell you the truth,
[41:56.55]没准他和弗兰西斯更般配呢 maybe he was a better wife to Francis.
[41:59.63]所以他根本无法清楚地认知事物 Which is why he was never able to see things clearly.
[42:05.43]他到底跟你说什么了  汤姆 I mean, what did he tell you, Tom?
[42:08.02]你觉得他告诉我什么你不想让我知道的事了 What do you think he told me that you don't want me to know?
[42:12.35]天啊  他肯定跟你说了很多疯狂臆想 Boy. The fantasies he must have reported to you.
[42:17.78]你不得不可怜他 You need to pity him.
[42:19.86]真的  我就可怜他 You really do. I do.
[42:21.57]总统女士  您这样擅自闯入 Madam President, this type of intrusion
[42:23.87]-公民的私人住所  -听着  我无法否认 - into a civilian's home... - Listen, there's no denying
[42:26.20]弗兰西斯是个不择手段的人  做了 that Francis was a desperate man who did,
[42:30.00]没错  做了许多不择手段的事 yes, a lot of desperate things.
[42:32.71]我不知道  也许到了最后 And I don't know. Maybe towards the end,
[42:35.46]他都有点精神错乱了 he was slightly deranged.
[42:38.00]但不管他做了什么  都是他自己做的 But whatever he did, he did alone.
[42:40.92]我都没有参与 I was not complicit.
[42:48.68]而且你  还记得最后一次 And do you... Do you remember the last interview
[42:51.69]采访我丈夫的时候吗 you did with my husband?
[42:53.73]在谈话的最后  他问你 And the conversation ended where he asked you
[42:56.52]你信不信他的话 if you'd believed what he'd told you.
[42:59.73]你还记得你怎么回答的吗 Do you remember how you responded, Tom?
[43:03.11]我记得 I do.
[43:08.49]我说  一点都不信 I said, "Not for a second."
[43:16.04]总统女士 Madam President,
[43:18.17]关于你是否是共犯的问题 when it comes to your complicity,
[43:20.55]我想我们最好还是在正式场合谈一谈 I think it's best if we meet under more formal circumstances.
[43:24.84]我会给你的新闻办公室发一份问题清单 I'll be sending over a list of questions to your press office.
[43:27.80]你可以通过书信或电邮来回答 You can answer them by mail, email.
[43:29.39]如果你愿意的话  当面录音采访也行 Or if you prefer, face-to-face and on the record.
[44:01.30]她给你扫房子扫了多少年 How many years did she clean up after you?
[44:04.34]我的母亲  你的管家 My mother, the housekeeper.
[44:12.22]从我看见你的那一刻  邓肯 From the second I saw you, Duncan.
[44:15.69]你那漂亮的  皱成一团的小脸 Your beautiful little scrunched up face.
[44:19.69]跟小老头一样 Like an old man.
[44:23.36]那一刻我就知道了 I just knew. It was instant.
[44:27.07]我们是一家人 We just belonged,
[44:29.74]是一家人  真的 we belonged, we did.
[44:34.79]那你为什么没有合法收养我 Why didn't you legally adopt me?
[44:42.46]我想大概是因为没必要吧 I guess, because I didn't have to.
[44:45.51]我父亲呢 And my father?
[44:48.55]是不是... Was it...
[44:50.68]不是不是 Oh, no, no, no.
[44:54.89]一夜情而已 A one night stand.

[45:16.37]我的生母 My birth mother.
[45:18.21]她的住处离这里不到半小时的车程 She lives not more than half an hour from here.
[45:21.04]这你知道吗 Did you know that?
[45:22.96]你和她说话了吗 Did you talk to her?
[45:25.51]我没敢 Couldn't.
[45:28.51]我不能那么对她 I couldn't do that to her.
[45:31.76]我只是 I just...
[45:34.56]我只是远远看着她 I just watched her.
[45:39.02]她怎么能把我... How could she let...
[45:40.40]我知道我能照顾好你 I knew I could take care of you.
[45:42.44]我也知道她照顾不好你 I knew she couldn't.
[45:49.36]就算你现在不想 If not now,
[45:52.20]我也希望你能原谅我 I hope you can forgive me.
[45:59.71]你还好吗  邓肯 You okay, Duncan?
[46:02.63]帮我说说  比尔 Help me, Bill.
[46:08.34]你的亲生父母是谁  从哪来的 Who your real parents were, where they came from...
[46:11.80]我根本就不在乎 I never cared about any of that.
[46:17.14]因为 Because...
[46:20.14]你知道因为什么 Well, you know why.
[46:22.31]那就说啊 Say it.
[46:24.65]他到底是什么人  比尔 Who he is, Bill.
[46:27.40]我受够了 I don't need this.
[46:29.19]你不要走 Stay where you are.
[46:30.03]-不  -邓肯 - No. - Duncan,
[46:31.28]如果你和我还想做一家人 if you and I are to have any chance,
[46:33.20]那你就不要走 you need to stay right here.
[46:39.37]比尔  快说啊 Bill, say it.

[46:48.13]亲爱的 Honey...
[46:48.76]他到底是什么人  快说啊你 Who is he, goddamn it?
[47:00.64]他不是咱家的人 He's not one of us.
[47:10.15]你个孬种 You're a coward.
[47:12.78]让克莱尔·黑尔替你说出来 Letting Claire Hale say it for you.
[47:16.74]我希望你快死 Well, I hope you die.
[47:19.95]我们走  走吧 Let's go. Now!
[47:37.85]电邮链接中的会议记录清楚地表明 The email links to corporate minutes that clearly indicate
[47:40.77]公司提前知道 a foreknowledge of hazard
[47:42.31]有发生危及生命安全的灾难的可能性 that resulted in catastrophic harm and loss of life.
[47:45.23]而列席会议并且同意公司政策的 In attendance and party to consent of the corporate policy
[47:48.77]正是公司总裁威廉·谢泼德 was the entity's chief executive officer William Shepherd.
[47:54.07]阿卡斯精炼厂负有责任 Arcas Refinery is liable.
[47:56.74]谢泼德无限责任公司也一样 As is Shepherd Unlimited.
[47:59.08]公司和比尔·谢泼德本人都可以被指控 The corporation and Bill Shepherd himself can be charged
[48:01.87]犯下过失杀人罪 with involuntary manslaughter.
[48:04.41]把他打成杀人犯 Expose him as a murderer
[48:06.12]顺便还能让他损失几十亿 and cost him billions in the process.
[48:09.79]斯克斯基女士会发表吗 Is Ms. Skorsky publishing?
[48:12.46]我亲自确保的 I made sure of it.
[48:16.22]等你逮捕他  故事就更精彩了 It's a better story once you arrest him.
[48:18.97]而这篇文章又可以支持逮捕 And the article will justify the arrest.
[48:22.56]我们可以请律师来  至少能拖一拖 We can get some lawyers in here and delay, at the very least.
[48:25.98]不 No.
[48:26.89]那我们可以安排他们从后门带你走 Then we can make sure they walk you out the back.
[48:28.44]不不不 No, no, no.
[48:30.19]不行  我想戴手铐 No, no. I want the cuffs.
[48:33.15]总统这次太过分了 President's gone too far this time.
[48:35.07]我想让全世界都看到 I want the whole world to see.
[48:38.49]我妹妹呢 And my sister?
[48:43.87]你可以在任何地方交给我  为什么在这里 You could've handed me this anywhere, why here?
[48:48.00]似乎这里更合适 Seemed appropriate.
[48:49.96]你可不是那种怀旧的人  道格 You never struck me as nostalgic, Doug.
[48:54.01]难道你还对弗兰西斯的死后赦免 Could this be about the posthumous pardoning
[48:56.88]还有痴心妄想吗 you've been imagining for Francis?
[48:58.47]你不属于这里 You don't belong here.
[49:02.60]我有时候真担心你胡思乱想 I sometimes worry about your imagination.
[49:05.27]你这奴隶一般的忠诚 Your slavish devotion.
[49:07.10]你无法去想他之外的事 You can't think beyond him. Not really.
[49:09.44]你离开白宫的景象  我倒是想象得很清楚 I can imagine you not in the White House quite clearly.
[49:12.23]我的天哪 Oh, my goodness.
[49:14.90]你要总是说这样的话 You keep saying things like that,
[49:16.44]我可能就不能放你走了 I might not be able to let you leave.

[50:41.95]好好玩  好吗  好 Just have fun, okay? Okay.
[51:07.39]刚刚收到的消息 And in breaking news just in,
[51:08.77]我们沉痛地宣布《华盛顿先驱报》 we are sad to report that one of the Washington Herald's
[51:11.06]最优秀的记者和主编  汤姆·哈默施密特 most accomplished journalists and editors Tom Hammerschmidt
[51:14.35]在一次抢劫中不幸中枪  当场身亡 was pronounced dead at the scene of a robbery gone terribly wrong.
[51:17.94]白宫很快发表了声明 The White House was quick to comment,
[51:19.36]说就在几小时前 as the President had sat down
[51:20.86]总统曾与这位获奖记者 with the award-winning Hammerschmidt
[51:22.36]进行过面对面的谈话 for an interview only hours before.
[51:24.49]除表达哀悼之外 Along with her condolences,
[51:25.41]总统也借此机会呼吁施行更严格的枪支管制 the President used the opportunity to call for greater gun control,
[51:28.87]尤其在市中心区 particularly in our inner cities.
[51:31.83]该死 Fuck!
[51:37.54]他给你的最后一样东西 The last thing he gave you.
[51:39.09]如果你不告诉我是什么意思的话 If you don't tell me what it means...
[51:41.46]我倒希望你能告诉我是什么意思  克莱尔 I was kind of hoping you could tell me, Claire.
[51:45.84]道格  汤姆·哈默施密特死了 Doug, Tom Hammerschmidt is dead.
[51:49.01]还有凯茜  简 Cathy, Jane.
[51:50.39]比尔·谢泼德也要去蹲监狱了 Bill Shepherd is going to prison.
[51:52.02]马克已经四面楚歌 Mark has no one to turn to.
[51:54.06]只有你和我了 It's just you and me.
[51:58.40]失陪一下 Gimme a moment, please.
[52:19.46]你得知道 Please know.
[52:25.22]让这三个可怜人的灵魂 The thought of accelerating the exit
[52:27.13]提前从人间消失的决定 of three poor souls from this earth
[52:29.85]非常痛苦 is beyond painful.
[53:10.89]抱歉了 Sorry about that.
[53:13.18]没关系 Not at all.
[53:18.64]我并不担心你  道格 I'm not worried about you anymore, Doug.
[53:23.11]你不会做任何伤害弗兰西斯的事  你做不到 You wouldn't do anything to hurt Francis. You're not capable.
[53:27.15]而且问题在于 And see, the thing is...
[53:29.70]不管弗兰西斯给你留下了什么  都不属于你 whatever Francis left you, it doesn't actually belong to you.
[53:33.91]我们结婚时  把个人和共有财产安排得很清楚 We entered our marriage with a his, hers and ours agreement.
[53:39.12]你的财产自己留着  任意处置 You keep and do whatever you want with yours,
[53:40.83]而我的也归我随意使用 I keep and do whatever I want with mine.
[53:43.67]你也想象得到  是我父母坚持的 My daddy and mother insisted, as you can imagine.
[53:47.30]不过这个婚前协议  有一个条款 But the prenup we had, had a clause.
[53:52.01]如果我们有了后代 If ever we have descendants together
[53:54.51]而其中一方先于对方离世 and one of us is first to die,
[53:57.14]我们同意将所有权利传给后代 we agree to waive our rights to everything passed on.
[54:00.23]这也就意味着 By which I mean,
[54:02.27]弗兰西斯所有的财产 all of Francis's assets
[54:04.32]都属于他的后代 are entitled to his heir.
[54:07.90]如果他有一个的话 If he should have one.
[54:21.54]上帝保佑  弗兰西斯和我有孩子了 Francis and I have been blessed.
[54:36.53]尽管同性恋婚姻合法化等热点议题在美国民众中越来越受到认同 美国百姓在堕胎合法性问题上的分歧并没有随着时间流逝有太多改变 根据盖洛普调查的历史数据  认为在怀孕的任何时间点  任何情况下 都可以堕胎的美国人  从1976年的22%缓慢增长到了2018年的29% 而在1976年有21%的美国人认为任何情况下都不能堕胎 这个比例到了2018年维持在20% 在两种极端观点变化不大的情况下  在过去四十年中 认为只有在特定情况下才可以堕胎的美国人也始终维持在50%左右
[55:21.52]在美国的两个政治党派中  共和党属于"支持生命派"  整体上反对堕胎 具体到不同的政客 有的极端保守派认为任何情况下堕胎都是对胎儿的谋杀 而一些温和派的共和党则同意只有在极端情况下 如被强奸  胎儿诊断出疾病  怀孕威胁母亲安全等  才可以进行堕胎 民主党则整体上是"支持选择派" 认为女性有权选择怎样对待自己的身体 拒绝认为胎儿是一个完整的生命 温和派的民主党认为堕胎要慎重  但是最终决定权在于母亲 而激进的民主党则认为 法律和社会在任何情况下都不应阻止怀孕妇女堕胎 在2016年大选中  共和党候选人特朗普是坚定的反堕胎者 而民主党候选人希拉里在这一问题上的态度 则从2008年时认为堕胎要慎重  转为强调堕胎是女性不可剥夺的权力
