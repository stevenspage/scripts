[00:22.45]他可不算是最令人振奋的副总统人选吧 This is not the most inspiring choice for a vice president, right?
[00:24.90]瑞秋·麦多秀
[00:26.26]他的确是位备受尊敬的官员  务实 I -- I mean, a well-respected operator. Pragmatic.
[00:29.19]但老实说 But let's face it.
[00:30.06]这也许只是总统对国会的示好 This is probably just a nod to Congress.
[00:31.70]提拔一名议员 Tapping one of their own.
[00:32.71]下次大选前  他也就是个充数的 It's really nothing more than a placeholder until 2016, assuredly.
[00:37.18]我对他私下宣誓就职毫不惊讶 I'm not surprised he's doing a private swearing-in.
[00:39.28]我猜总统是想 My bet is that the president wants to draw
[00:40.67]尽量保持低调 as little attention to this as possible.
[00:42.48]这其中实在没什么让人... There's just no real wow fa--
[00:51.04]克里斯蒂娜怎么样 Christina's working out well?
[00:52.66]还在适应  不过我目前挺满意的 She's getting her sea legs, but I've been happy so far.
[00:55.19]她很勤奋 She works hard.
[00:56.61]她能替我陪总统出行 It's a big load off my shoulders
[00:57.57]我可是大大松了一口气 when she can travel with the president instead of me.
[01:00.34]我留在这边更有用武之地 I get so much more done when I stay here.
[01:04.73]总统有看好的党鞭人选吗 The president have a preference in the whip's race?
[01:06.62]没想到局面会变得这么不堪 Can't believe how ugly it's gotten.
[01:08.91]真让人无比失望 It was more disappointing than anything.
[01:10.39]当心  是啊 Watch out. Yeah, it was.
[01:12.15]没打扰你们吧 I hope I'm not interrupting.
[01:13.29]没有 Not at all.
[01:13.87]这可真是不一般 This is something else.
[01:15.17]安保要求  他们得赶工  小心 Security specs. They had to work fast. Watch out.
[01:17.33]这里简直像战场 It's like a war zone around here.
[01:19.09]改建的目的就是隔绝外界影响 The idea is to keep the war from getting in.
[01:21.33]党鞭的竞争怎么样了  议员先生 How's the whip's race coming, congressman?
[01:23.26]你和霍华德的竞争蛮激烈的 It's tight between you and Howard.
[01:24.66]这你得问他 Well you'd have to ask Howard,
[01:25.93]不过他大概在忙着琢磨怎么搞我 if he's not too busy trying to sodomize me.
[01:28.39]去打个招呼吧 Shall we go and say hello?
[01:29.36]天呐  别逼我跟他说话 For god sakes, don't make me talk to that man.
[01:34.86]你好  霍华德 Good to see you, Howard.
[01:36.92]见到你真高兴  韦斯 Nice to see you, Wes.
[01:38.86]高兴个屁啊 Yeah. I bet it is.
[01:53.78]-鲍勃  -弗兰克 - Bob. - Frank.
[01:55.28]谢谢你邀请我  弗兰克 Appreciate you inviting me, Frank.
[01:56.53]-什么  -谢谢你邀请我 - What? - Thanks for inviting me.
[01:57.89]不客气 You bet.
[02:00.24]法官大人 Judge. 总统及副总统宣誓就职时需由最高法院首席法官见证
[02:03.27]你好啊 Good to see you.
[02:04.66]有换衣服的地吗 Is there somewhere I can go to change?
[02:06.30]当然有  大厅那边 Yes, absolutely. There's room down the hall.
[02:08.31]道格  照应一下法官 Doug, will you take care of the judge?
[02:10.55]他准备好了就赶紧开始 And when he's ready, let's get this thing over with.
[02:12.25]我去叫大家进来 I'll start bringing 'em in.

[02:19.14]我自愿承担此义务 ...that I take this obligation freely,
[02:20.79]既无保留  也不逃避 without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion...
[02:23.49]我将尽职尽责 And that I will well...
[02:24.62]离总统只差一步 One heartbeat away from the presidency,
[02:26.33]却不用一张选票 and not a single vote cast in my name.
[02:29.01]民主也不过如此 Democracy is so overrated.
[02:30.49]完成我的本职工作  上帝保佑 ...office on which I am about to enter, so help me God.
[02:33.95]我将尽职尽责 And that I will well and faithfully discharge
[02:36.57]完成我的本职工作 the duties of the office on which I am about to enter,
[02:39.52]上帝保佑 so help me god.
[02:41.32]祝贺你  副总统先生 Congratulations, Mr. Vice President.
[02:56.25]好了  我们继续治理国家吧 All right, let's get back to running the country.
[04:33.90]你们中一人将接任党鞭 Now, one of you is gonna replace me as the whip.
[04:36.13]你们俩最有希望  大家也知道你们都想争取 You're the two frontrunners, and we know you both want it.
[04:38.40]可你们一点领导风范也没有 And you're not behaving like men who belong in the leadership.
[04:41.86]场面话就别说了 We need to tone down the rhetoric.
[04:43.50]你们伤及了党派利益 You're hurting your party.
[04:44.70]我只是在回应霍华德抛出的谎言 I'm just responding to the lies Howard's been slinging.
[04:46.98]公费出游是真事  韦斯  不是我编的 Those junkets happened, Wes. I'm not making it up.
[04:49.05]那你任人唯亲呢 And nepotism's any better.
[04:50.29]你知道那不是事实 That's just not true, and you know it.
[04:51.79]所以你妹夫 And your sister's husband
[04:52.65]是凑巧被任命为财务部长了吗 just happened to be appointed state treasurer.
[04:54.11]前妹夫  是的 Ex-husband. And yes.
[04:56.36]真是一派胡言  霍华德 That is such a load of crap, Howard.
[04:57.78]先生们  鲍勃说的对 Gentlemen, Bob is right.
[04:59.54]你俩的斗争一旦被曝光 This sort of cat-fighting gets out in the press,
[05:01.82]不管谁赢  都不是好事 whichever one of you wins hits the ground limping.
[05:04.71]别出阴招了  大家文明一点 Let's keep it clean and bring some civility back to the house.
[05:08.68]可以吗 Can we agree to that?
[05:13.08]你俩握个手我会安心一些 I'd feel a lot better if you shook hands on it.
[05:22.09]谢谢 Thank you.
[05:30.50]我和他在一起呢  克里斯蒂娜 I'm with him right now, Christina.
[05:33.05]我走了  我晚些时候去你办公室 I'm off. I'll swing by your office later.
[05:35.19]不用了  还没装修好呢 Don't. It's not ready yet.
[05:36.19]我就在这儿办公了 I'll be working from here.
[05:37.41]什么事 What?
[05:38.50]塔斯克来了 Tusk is in town.
[05:39.46]他45分钟后和总统会面 He's meeting with the president in 45 minutes.
[05:41.20]克里斯蒂娜刚告诉我的 Christina just told me.
[05:42.15]商贸联委会谈判的事 The Joint Commission talks.
[05:43.43]她就是这么说的 That's what she said.
[05:44.41]克里斯蒂娜还真有用 Christina is proving useful.
[05:46.01]我们随时联系 We stay in touch.
[05:46.98]给凯茜·杜兰特打电话 Get me Cathy Durant.
[05:48.45]你的人要过来吗 Your people coming by?
[05:49.71]就只有我的新办公室主任 Just my new chief of staff.
[05:51.30]招人之前也没有别人了 That's all I've got until we hire more.
[05:53.15]做副总统的夫人什么感觉 So how does it feel to be married to the vice president?
[05:56.61]完全一样  就是有点吵 Exactly the same. Just louder.
[06:00.41]国务卿杜兰特 Secretary Durant.
[06:02.86]凯西 Cathy.
[06:06.45]雷蒙德 Raymond.
[06:10.13]祝贺你  副总统先生 Congratulations, Mr. Vice President.
[06:12.69]非常感谢 Thank you very much.
[06:14.34]向你介绍国务卿  杜兰特 May I please introduce Secretary Durant.
[06:16.99]很荣幸  国务卿女士 My pleasure, Madam Secretary.
[06:20.97]简直太意外了 This is quite a surprise.
[06:22.35]我根本不知道你来了 I had no idea you were in town.
[06:45.18]早上好  总统阁下 Morning, sir.
[06:47.20]总统先生 Mr. President.
[06:48.52]凯瑟琳 Catherine.
[06:49.62]我们刚好撞见了雷蒙德 We just happened to run into Raymond.
[06:52.99]太好了 Wonderful.
[06:54.56]进来吧 Come on in.
[06:58.52]电话记录肯定能证明我是对的 The phone records will absolutely prove I'm right.
[07:00.86]根本就没有电话记录  你知道的 There were no phone records. You know that.
[07:02.32]那还有运营商的数据历史记录 The data history with the carrier.
[07:04.08]重新调查根本不可能  就算重新调查了 Even if we got the case reopened, which isn't gonna happen,
[07:06.49]你知道要拿到获取运营商数据的令状有多难吗 do you have any idea how hard it is to get a warrant for phone data?
[07:09.77]合理理由 Probable cause.
[07:10.98]把他找来进行讯问 Bring him in for questioning.
[07:12.79]严格说这事在你辖区之内 Technically you have jurisdiction.
[07:13.96]美国的副总统 The vice president of the United States.
[07:15.14]我知道你觉得这很荒谬 I know this all sounds preposterous to you,
[07:16.73]但如果你好好看看我的笔记 but if -- if you go through my notes --
[07:18.09]我早就看过了 We've been through your notes.
[07:19.60]你听是听了  但你根本没听进去 You've listened. But you haven't heard me.
[07:21.89]的确是间接证据  但都合情合理 Circumstantial, yes. But plausible.
[07:24.67]我知道你曾为更小的原因重新调查案子 I know you've reopened cases on less.
[07:27.95]你必须停手了  哥们 This has gotta stop, man.
[07:29.43]我们说来说去就这么几句 We keep having the same conversation.
[07:31.17]不可能是意外 It can't be an accident.
[07:36.62]好吧  我给你看个东西 Okay. I'm gonna show you something.
[07:42.40]CNN想拿到这个 CNN tried to get a hold of this.
[07:44.22]出于对家属的尊重  我们拒绝了 We eighty-sixed it out of respect to the family.
[07:47.13]监控录像吗 The footage?
[07:50.69]加密文件
[07:53.00]你看了肯定难受 It's not easy to watch.
[07:54.42]我想看 I want to see it.
[08:01.45]她要么是绊倒了  要么是跳下去的 She tripped. Or jumped.
[08:07.41]她不是自杀 She didn't jump.
[08:13.84]我逐帧放给你看 Here it is, frame by frame.
[08:31.10]还有两个目击证人 Now, there were two witnesses.
[08:32.38]一个是患眼部黄斑变性的70岁老太太 One was a 70-year-old woman with macular degeneration.
[08:35.19]她什么都没看清楚 All she saw was a blur.
[08:36.22]第二个就是车上的列车员 The second was the conductor of the train.
[08:37.79]他说看上去像是她摔倒了 He said it looked like she fell.
[08:39.20]除了这两个证人  就是监控录像了 I mean between those two and this video, that's all there is.
[08:44.27]想看你可以看一万遍  但是这个案子结了 You can watch it a million times, but this case is closed.
[08:50.18]我们得把议程限制在几个关键问题上 We should limit the agenda to a couple of key issues:
[08:53.44]工业制品的进口关税 import tariffs on industrial manufactured goods
[08:57.01]以及稀土元素的出口限额 and export quotas on rare earth elements.
[09:00.24]他们把这两个都当做政治杠杆 They're using both as political levers.
[09:02.59]我也认为在这两个问题上我们能有所进展 I agree these are two areas where we can make meaningful progress.
[09:05.71]但我更担心针对企业的网络攻击的增加 But I'm worried about the rise in corporate cyber attacks.
[09:08.88]扯上这个就没完了 That's a rabbit hole.
[09:11.29]我们早晚得说这件事 Well, we have to address it sooner or later.
[09:13.57]问题是我们要不要现在谈这个 It's just a matter of whether we want to address it now.
[09:15.71]中国人不喜欢意外 The Chinese don't like surprises.
[09:17.64]我只是想说 All I'm proposing is that
[09:19.38]我们现在利用商贸联委会谈判委婉地提出这个问题 we use the Joint Commission talks to bring it up gently now,
[09:22.30]为下轮谈判做好铺垫 set the stage for the next round.
[09:23.97]我是个商人  不是外交官 Look, I'm a businessman, not a diplomat.
[09:26.03]但是我是个在中国工作了35年的商人 But I'm a businessman with 35 years experience working in China.
[09:30.16]和他们谈判  不能太贪心 When they come to the table, you don't get greedy.
[09:32.52]你在福建有一个合资炼油厂 You're working on a co-venture refinery project in Fujian.
[09:35.55]这也是业内首家 Which would be the first of its kind.
[09:37.79]放开了增加投资的渠道... Open the gateway for increased investment --
[09:40.43]网络攻击对那些合作企业构成威胁 Cyber attacks threaten those co-ventures.
[09:43.24]如果中方可以通过 There's less a need for them
[09:44.23]商业间谍活动获取新技术  也就无需合作了 if the Chinese can obtain new technology from corporate espionage.
[09:48.18]弗兰克  你觉得呢 Frank, what do you think?
[09:49.27]我更倾向于雷蒙德的想法 I lean more toward Raymond's thinking.
[09:51.09]如果引起中方的反感  那多年的努力都白费了 If we antagonize the Chinese we could undo years of progress.
[09:54.37]我可以低调行事  绝不会使强硬手腕 Allow me to do this quietly, with a soft touch.
[09:57.45]我不会激怒他们  先生 I won't antagonize them, sir.
[09:59.20]我们最不需要的就是自找麻烦 The last thing we want to do is rock the boat.
[10:01.56]你想怎么办  凯瑟琳 What do you have in mind, Catherine?
[10:02.86]建议性议程 A suggested agenda.
[10:05.18]而不是作为要求 Not a demand.
[10:06.40]这件事由中层出面  我根本不插手 We'll keep it mid-level. I won't get anywhere near it.
[10:10.26]雷蒙德 Raymond?
[10:11.91]我已经表明了顾虑 I've voiced my concerns.
[10:17.74]-要格外谨慎克制  -我向你保证  先生 - A very soft touch. - You have my word, sir.
[10:21.53]好 Good.
[10:24.32]雷蒙德  一起吃个午餐吧 Raymond? Want to grab some lunch?
[10:28.98]乐意之极 Would love to.
[10:30.41]谢谢  弗兰克  欢迎加入白宫 Thanks, Frank. Welcome to the West Wing.
[10:32.80]谢谢你  先生 Thank you, sir.
[10:40.97]总统就像旷野上的一棵孤树 The president is like a lone tree in an empty field.
[10:44.47]风往哪吹  他就往哪倒 He leans whichever way the wind is blowing.
[10:46.54]现在雷蒙德·塔斯克的西风吹得实在太猛 And right now Raymond Tusk blows far too strong from the west.
[10:51.16]那是假发吗 Is that a wig?
[10:53.14]不是  他都留了好几个月了 No. He's been growing it out for months.
[10:57.12]戴安说她喜欢长发 Diane says she likes it long.
[10:59.45]我告诉她  等她看到 I told her she'll feel differently
[11:01.71]他留起长发辩就会改主意了 once she sees the first dread lock.
[11:04.04]或者闻到 Or smells it.
[11:09.78]我上周去看了你女儿 I went to see your daughter last weekend.
[11:14.51]她怎么样 How is she?
[11:15.70]-想看看照片吗  -好啊 - You want to see a picture? - Okay.
[11:20.94]-她妈妈在吗  -对 - Was her mother there? - Yeah.
[11:24.27]他们的钱够用吧 Are they okay on money?
[11:25.56]格林伍兹的保险率费一月份要上调了 The rate at Greenwoods is going up in January.
[11:28.36]凯特琳娜担心钱不够用 Catalina is worried she's gonna be short.
[11:31.33]我会多打点去她账上 I'll make sure to put more into the account.
[11:33.60]如果你不舒服  我们不用聊她 We don't have to talk about her if you don't...
[11:35.54]不不  没事  我很感谢你去看她 No, no, no. It's fine. I appreciate you going to see her.
[11:39.32]抱歉  泰德 I'm sorry, Ted.
[11:40.09]你邀我一起吃午餐  我以为你是想... I thought that when you asked me to lunch it was because you want --
[11:42.27]不不  没错 No, no, no. I mean, yes,
[11:45.70]我想确保她们的需求都得到满足 I want to make sure they have what they need.
[11:48.41]但是  不 But, no,
[11:50.24]我想找你谈是为了... the reason I wanted to talk --
[11:56.05]洛莉·塔特 Lorrie Tate.
[11:57.41]洛莉是我朋友  她怎么了 Lorrie's a friend of mine. What about her?
[12:01.44]她说你有意竞选党鞭 She mentioned you're interested in the whip's race.
[12:04.52]天呐 Oh, no.
[12:07.65]真希望她没这么说 I wish she hadn't.
[12:09.20]为什么 Why not?
[12:10.36]因为很荒唐啊 Because it's ridiculous.
[12:12.93]是吗 Is it?
[12:17.26]我只是随口说说 I just mentioned it off-hand.
[12:19.63]韦斯和巴克沃特的竞争简直... The whole Webb and Buchwalter thing is just --
[12:22.14]一团糟 Complete mess.
[12:23.82]但我是开玩笑的 But I wasn't serious.
[12:25.04]我觉得你该认真想想 I think you should be serious.
[12:27.27]你想竞选党鞭吗 Do you want to do it?
[12:28.32]我没有经验啊  泰德  我还... I don’t have the experience, Ted. And I -- I --
[12:30.85]想不想 Yes or no?
[12:31.56]当然想 Yes, of course.
[12:33.86]将来再说 Someday.
[12:34.74]但现在  我没有他们那样的财力 But now I -- I don't have the money they do.
[12:37.61]你用我的钱  就有了 Unless you use mine.
[12:39.74]你不能把你的钱浪费在... You can't waste your money on --
[12:41.24]如果我找到那些还持观望态度的人 If I funnel my PAC money to
[12:43.86]把我的政治行动委员会资金给他们一些 some folks who are on the fence,
[12:45.00]在你正式宣布前  拉拢一些支持者 round up a couple dozen commitments before you announce,
[12:48.80]那你立刻就是有力竞争者 that would make you an instant contender.
[12:51.98]你说这是浪费吗 Now tell me that's a waste.
[12:53.54]这可是千百万啊 We're talking hundreds of thousands.
[12:55.33]这可不是圣诞礼物  杰姬 It's not a Christmas present, Jackie.
[12:58.08]如果你是党鞭  我就在领导层有了坚定的盟友 With you as whip I have a strong ally in the leadership.
[13:01.02]我的获益不比你少 I stand to gain as much as you.
[13:04.93]稍等片刻 Hang on one second.
[13:06.98]我不知道哪里... I don't know where the...
[13:11.63]怎么样  他信了吗 How did it go? Did he buy it?
[13:13.44]不管你给他吹了什么风  吹得很到位 Whatever bug you put in his ear burrowed deep.
[13:16.49]很简单  那人喜欢你  对你视如己出 It was easy. The man adores you like you're his own child.
[13:19.23]但你可得选我做首席副党鞭 But you sure as hell better make me Chief Deputy.
[13:21.99]我得先当选 I need to win first.
[13:23.63]我和泰德两票  还剩111票 Ted and I make two. 111 to go.
[13:26.66]副党鞭会数数总是好事 It's always good when the Chief Deputy knows her arithmetic.
[13:29.03]别扯淡  我们数票吧 Fuck off. Let's start taking names.
[13:32.04]这个还不错 This one seems promising.
[13:33.50]康纳·埃利斯  可靠  有经验 Connor Ellis. He's solid. Good experience.
[13:37.50]是他解决了琼斯参议员 Oh, he's the one that got Senator Jones out of that mess
[13:37.50]借调查名义影响民意的民意调查

[13:47.43]我们说说日程的事 Let's talk about the schedule.
[13:49.55]好好挑一下我该参加哪些活动 I think we need to be more selective with the events I do.
[13:54.01]有些是上任副总统夫人没去成的 Some of these are leftovers from Mrs. Matthews.
[13:56.00]你想取消也可以 We can cancel whatever you like.
[13:59.02]这是什么 And what's this?
[14:00.66]你丈夫要为两位新晋海军陆战队将军授衔 Your husband will be pinning stars on two newly commissioned Marine generals.
[14:04.17]这个你应该去 I think that's one you should do.
[14:05.50]给我介绍一下 Okay. Walk me through it.
[14:07.24]两位将军分别是艾莉西娅·汉普顿 The generals are Alicia Hampton
[14:09.38]和道顿·麦金尼斯 and Dalton McGinnis.

[14:33.77]可你是国务卿啊 but you're the secretary of state.
[14:36.02]塔斯克怎么能参与决策 I mean, Tusk should not be determining policy.
[14:38.25]只有总统可以决定你该怎么做 The president alone should instruct you on what you are to pursue.
[14:41.96]他们什么关系 What's their relationship?
[14:43.56]他一直给总统出谋划策 He's had his ear for years.
[14:45.24]提建议 An advisor...
[14:46.48]更像是导师  总统很重视他的建议 More of a mentor. And one whose advice is not easily dismissed.
[14:49.57]他还会继续要求忽视网络战 He's gonna keep pushing back on cyber warfare.
[14:51.66]除非我给提上议程 Not if I get it on the agenda.
[14:53.08]不  你提上议程他更会来劲 No, especially if you get it on the agenda.
[14:56.05]商贸联委会谈判再度开启时 Tusk is not gonna take any chances
[14:57.51]塔斯克绝不会冒丝毫风险 when the next Joint Commission talks come around.
[15:00.39]你刚刚不是支持他吗 You agreed with him in the meeting.
[15:02.23]如果我们站一边  他的态度只会更强硬 If we had ganged up, he would have taken a firmer position.
[15:05.09]说不定 For all we know,
[15:05.97]他现在就在劝总统改主意呢 he's convincing the president right now to change his mind.
[15:09.13]所以我们绝不能给他机会 Now we need to remove that option as a possibility.
[15:13.18]怎么办 How?
[15:15.65]下次谈判时  强迫中方回应网络安全问题 Force the Chinese to confront the issue now, this round of talks.
[15:19.68]我答应总统不采取强硬手段的 I promised the president a soft touch.
[15:21.63]我不能有意食言 I can't intentionally break my promise.
[15:24.48]如果是无意的呢 What if it was unintentional?
[15:28.94]凯茜  如果你不喜欢现在的局势 Cathy, if you don't like how the table is set,
[15:31.74]就干脆搅局 turn over the table.
[15:38.30]你偷吸 You're cheating.
[15:39.63]哪有  是电子烟 No, I'm not. It's vapor.
[15:41.62]那也算 Still.
[15:43.02]你该试试 You should try it.
[15:44.83]会上瘾  但没副作用 Addiction without the consequences.
[15:47.12]你自己抽 It's all yours.
[15:49.76]不睡吗 You staying up?
[15:52.98]明晚的授衔仪式 This ceremony tomorrow night.
[15:55.10]你不想去 You don't want to go.
[15:56.46]除非我必须去 If I don't have to.
[15:58.10]我也不喜欢 I hate these sorta things, too.
[15:59.87]但这是副总统的首次亮相 But it is my first public appearance as vice president.
[16:05.80]好吧 Okay.
[16:06.71]谢谢 Thank you.
[16:12.89]要不要把这儿改成办公室 Should we turn this into a proper office?
[16:16.29]可以啊  楼下没有私密性 That's not a bad idea. No privacy downstairs.
[16:20.76]我去找装修队 I'll talk to the contractor.
[16:23.45]晚安  弗兰西斯 Goodnight, Francis.
[16:24.69]晚安 Goodnight.
[16:48.03]先生  先生  根据国会议事录 Sir! Sir! Congressional Record.
[16:49.70]不是要谈到六点吗 Weren't the talks supposed to go until six?
[16:51.51]他们不听  我们谈不下去 We can't talk if they won't listen.
[16:52.95]中方不谈了吗 Did the Chinese walk out?
[16:54.33]我们已经表明  除非他们肯谈政府资助的 We made it clear that we won't discuss any other issues
[16:56.36]网络攻击  否则其他问题免谈 until government-sponsored cyber attacks are on the table.
[16:59.23]显然他们不开心了 Apparently that's not what they wanted to hear.
[17:00.66]中方代表离席之前你说了什么 Sir, what did you tell the Chinese delegation before they walked out?
[17:03.38]我们没派人去 We didn't have anybody there.
[17:04.63]商贸联委会谈判通常很无聊的 The Joint Commission is usually a snooze-fest.
[17:06.86]今天不是 Not today it wasn't.
[17:08.10]我已经让格里尔去弄了 I've got Greer on it.
[17:09.31]这不是国际板块的新闻吗 Isn't this international?
[17:11.12]如果要写网络战的背景资料 We need somebody from the tech beat
[17:12.23]就得请科技板块的记者 if we want any background on cyber warfare.
[17:14.75]他找到人接受署名采访了吗 Does he have anybody on record yet?
[17:16.28]中方不肯谈 The Chinese aren't talking.
[17:17.17]美国代表团的话美联社都报道了 And all the U.S. delegation said is what's in the AP wire.
[17:19.63]无论如何两小时内网上要出报道 I want something online in the next two hours.
[17:21.80]本周内发一篇深入后续报道 In-depth follow-up sometime this week.
[17:26.02]卢卡斯  你还好吗 Hey, Lucas? You all right?
[17:31.42]好啊  怎么了 Yeah. Why?
[17:33.69]你还穿着昨天穿的那身 You're wearing the same clothes you wore yesterday.
[17:37.71]是吗 Am I?
[17:39.18]我不知道你私生活发生了什么 I don't know what's going on in your personal life,
[17:42.17]但似乎已经影响到你的工作了 but it seems to be entering the workplace.
[17:44.05]仪表很重要 Appearances matter.
[17:45.23]我们的编辑不能比他的记者 And we can't have an editor looking more disheveled
[17:47.06]还不修边幅 than his reporters.
[17:49.29]两小时  一定给你个交待 Two hours. You'll have something.
[17:52.19]你知道杰姬·夏普要竞选党鞭吗 Did you know Jackie Sharp's running for Whip?
[17:54.48]不知道  这是我第一次听说 No, this is the first I'm hearing of it.
[17:56.10]我跟韦伯说了 I spoke to Webb.
[17:57.36]洛莉·塔特给他发了一封关于我的电邮 He got an email from Lorrie Tate about me.
[17:59.25]戴夫·霍兰德给我发了一封关于他的电邮 I got one from Dave Holland about him.
[18:01.19]这我不管 Which means nothing to me.
[18:02.43]公费旅游  任人唯亲  塔特跟夏普很亲密 The junkets, the nepotism. Tate and Sharp are close.
[18:06.12]霍兰德跟她在退伍军人事务委员会共事过 Holland serves on the VA committee with her.
[18:08.05]她找别人出手  好撇清干系 She used proxies to insulate herself.
[18:09.73]你觉得是她把料爆给了他们 So you think that she gave the dirt to them.
[18:12.06]没错  她在耍我们两个人 Yeah. She's been playing both of us.
[18:13.38]你觉得她能拉到多少支持者 How many commitments do you think she could have?
[18:15.17]目前也就20个左右吧 Around 20 so far.
[18:16.34]那她还是被你俩远远甩在后面啊 So she's a distant third.
[18:17.86]但她在一个个动摇我们的支持者啊 But she's picking people off us left and right.
[18:20.20]你得帮我 I want your help.
[18:20.75]我支持你啊  韦斯 You have my support, Wes.
[18:22.61]那就公开表态 Then make that public.
[18:24.00]如果我公开支持你  博奇就会支持韦伯 If I come out for you, Birch comes out for Webb.
[18:26.60]那反倒会害你  而不是帮你 That's gonna hurt you, not help you.
[18:28.16]情况很不妙  弗兰克 This is serious, Frank.
[18:29.61]泰德·哈维梅耶在赞助她 Ted Havemeyer is bankrolling her.
[18:31.35]你想过跟杰姬谈谈吗 Have you thought of talking to Jackie?
[18:32.96]没有  原则上我不能那么做 No, no. I can't do that on principle.
[18:35.86]为什么不行 Why not?
[18:36.52]我不会跟哈维梅耶支持的人合作 Anyone who Havemeyer is backing, I don't work with.
[18:39.46]我竞选参议员的时候  他也搅了我的局 He pulled the same crap on me when I ran for Senate.
[18:41.68]他赞助我的主要对手  混蛋 He financed my primary opponent. Asshole.
[18:44.38]那由你决定 Well, that is your call.
[18:45.54]但如果你要让旧账阻碍你的竞选 But if you're gonna let an old grudge get in the way of progress --
[18:47.67]我就是不能这么做  弗兰克 I just can't do it, Frank.
[18:49.20]哈维梅耶这些年一直想把我赶下去 Havemeyer's been trying to shove me down the totem pole for years.
[18:52.22]我不会让他得逞的 I won't give him the satisfaction.
[18:53.71]我尊重你  但这样我就无能为力了 Well, I can respect that, but my hands are tied.
[18:57.53]这件事很微妙 It's a delicate matter,
[18:58.47]但我们正在和中国政府沟通 but we are in communication with the Chinese government
[19:01.03]如何推进谈判 as to how to move forward.
[19:02.22]这是不是表示美国将在网络攻击的事上屈服 Does this mean the U.S. will back down on cyber attacks?
[19:03.92]美国从不屈服 The United States never backs down,
[19:05.71]特别是在重要问题上 particularly on issues that are high priority to us.
[19:08.75]国务卿女士  您是怎么 Madam Secretary, what did you--
[19:09.85]谢谢 Thank you.
[19:10.64]您是怎么跟代表团团长说的 What did you tell the head of the delegation?
[19:16.52]代表团越界了 The delegation overstepped its bounds,
[19:18.47]但凯茜不能坑她自己的人 but Cathy couldn’t throw her own people under the bus.
[19:20.78]她公开发表言论前该先跟我们商量一下 She should have consulted us first before speaking publicly.
[19:23.41]媒体堵在她家门口 The press was on her doorstep
[19:24.69]总统又在地球另一端 and the president was in another hemisphere.
[19:26.24]我不是在批评她的做法 Now, look, I'm not condemning what she did,
[19:28.24]但她总得采取措施 but she had to do something.
[19:29.76]她凭直觉做决定  并采取了行动 She made a gut call and she acted.
[19:32.33]咱们得撇清关系 We have to distance ourselves from this.
[19:34.20]总统什么时候回来 When is the president back?
[19:35.37]明天早上 Tomorrow morning.
[19:36.10]我们能安排一次会面吗 Can we set up a meeting?
[19:37.28]凯茜得公开道歉 Cathy needs to publicly apologize.
[19:39.20]我们能让她跟总统谈谈吗 Can we get her in the room with the president?
[19:40.90]我们不应该先统一一下步调吗 Shouldn't we all be on the same page first?
[19:43.22]我再想想办法吧 I'll see what I can do.
[19:44.04]谢谢 Thank you.

[30:45.10]他把床单塞进我嘴里 He shoved the sheets in my mouth.
[30:46.90]我几乎无法呼吸 I could barely breathe.
[30:55.82]每次我想起那个女孩 Every time I think of her
[30:58.93]被人那样按倒 pinned down like that
[31:01.09]我都会勒死她  弗朗西斯 I strangle her, Francis,

[31:08.90]我必须那样  我们必须那样 I have to. We have to.
[31:16.24]否则... The alternative is --
[31:19.98]我无法忍受 it's unlivable.

[31:33.37]我不知道能不能睡着 I'm not sure if I can.
[31:36.56]那你就回楼下去 Then you should go back downstairs.
[31:56.03]早晨的时候  恨意也不会消退 You'll still feel the hate in the morning.
[32:00.12]你会利用那份恨意  但不是去报复他 You'll use that. But not on him.
[32:16.85]你到底说了什么 What did you communicate, exactly?
[32:18.81]我让他提出议事日程 I told him to bring up the agenda,
[32:20.44]指出战略对话的关键点  但别提要求 suggest bullet points for the SED, but make no demands.
[32:23.53]那怎么会被理解成最后通牒 And how did that translate into a direct ultimatum?
[32:26.80]有时我的代表会探究言外之意 Well, sometimes my delegates try to read between the lines.
[32:30.16]他们知道我为外交目的需要合理推卸责任 They know that I need plausible deniability for diplomatic purposes.
[32:33.91]那你为什么没有立刻否认 Why didn't you immediately recant?
[32:35.32]就我跟中国人打交道的经验看 In my experience with the Chinese,
[32:37.08]变卦会让他们觉得我们软弱 backpedaling makes us look weak.
[32:38.68]我当时有两个选择  丢脸或展示实力 I had two choices: Lose face or exhibit strength.
[32:42.69]我选择了后者 I chose the latter.

[33:13.02]我在北京的联系人 My contacts in Beijing
[33:14.42]跟我说商务部部长很激动 tell me the minister of commerce is in a tizzy.
[33:17.27]他想以此为借口重拳出击 Wants to use this as an excuse to start clenching fists.
[33:20.33]我要么拆凯茜的台  要么支持她 Well, either I turn my back on Cathy or I stand behind her.
[33:22.98]选前者 It's gotta be the former.
[33:24.07]我同意 I agree.
[33:25.13]如果你不道歉 If you don't apologize,
[33:26.30]那就不是小矛盾  而是大摩擦了 you go from ruffling feathers to plucking them.
[33:28.99]中国人绝不会忍气吞声  总统先生 And the Chinese won't stand for that, Mr. President.
[33:31.31]说是我跟内阁之间意思传达有错误如何 What about perceived miscommunication between me and my cabinet?
[33:33.93]总统先生  现在的目标是继续谈判 Mr. President, right now the goal is to resume the talks.
[33:36.77]就别担心他们是怎么想的了 I wouldn't worry about perceptions.
[33:38.45]弗兰克没错  我们得现实点 Frank is right. We need to be pragmatic.
[33:40.79]先别担心场面上的事 Worry about appearances later.
[33:46.07]行  我让凯瑟琳拟一份致歉信 All right. I'll have Catherine draft an apology.
[33:48.19]不  必须由你亲自写  总统先生 No, it has to come from you, Mr. President.
[33:50.89]道歉要有份量 If the apology is to mean anything,
[33:52.29]就得由白宫出面 it must come from the White House.
[33:54.00]这样的确应该更有成效 That is certainly the more likely to succeed.
[33:59.98]行  那我亲自写  谢谢  雷蒙德 Fine. I'll do it then. Thank you, Raymond.
[34:02.47]谢谢你  加勒特 Thank you, Garrett.
[34:06.25]你听到他仍然直呼总统的名字吗 Do you hear how he still uses the president's given name?
[34:09.76]而沃克也毫不在意他的失敬 And that Walker doesn't flinch at the lack of respect it implies.
[34:17.22]先生  恕我直言 Sir, forgive me if this isn't the case,
[34:19.60]你好像有点犹豫 but you seem a bit hesitant.
[34:22.28]为什么这么说 Why do you say that?
[34:22.98]关于公众看法的事  你所言极是 Well, you've raised a good point about public perception.
[34:25.42]我不想让你觉得 I don't want you to think that
[34:26.17]我对你的担忧毫不在意 I'm dismissing your concerns casually.
[34:28.94]没有  你也担心这个吗 No. It's a concern for you, too?
[34:31.58]凯茜提出的观点不无道理 There is some insight into what Cathy brought up.
[34:34.01]变卦就是软弱 Backpedalling is weakness.
[34:38.86]跟中国人合作总是碰运气 Well, it's always a coin toss with the Chinese.
[34:41.42]但有时候坚定立场比让步妥协要好 But sometimes standing your ground is better than giving in.
[34:46.21]你强势  他们反而更尊重你 They respect you more when you show strength.
[34:50.97]你改变对此的看法了吗  弗兰克 Are you changing your mind on this, Frank?
[34:52.99]我只是觉得  你该按自己的心意决定 I just think it's important that you do what you think is best.
[34:57.52]美国人民选你当总统 The American people voted you president.
[35:00.11]不是我  也不是雷蒙德·塔斯克 Not me. Not Raymond Tusk.

[35:24.44]你和我 You and I,
[35:26.60]我们得合作  韦斯 we need to work together on this, Wes.
[35:29.07]否则我们俩都得完蛋 Before we both get screwed.
[35:30.52]我同意 I agree.
[35:34.89]我们中一个人退出 One of us drops out,
[35:37.28]支持另一个人 throws support to the other.
[35:39.93]这就能削弱她的支持力量 That'll dwarf any following she has.
[35:42.55]你想让我退出吗 You want me to drop out.
[35:44.96]我一定任命你做众议院拨款委员会主席 I'll make sure you get my chairmanship on appropriations.
[35:50.94]你至多能任命我做纪律委员会主席  这没人稀罕 All you can offer me is, uh, Ethics, which nobody wants.
[35:58.60]我们把事定下来吧  韦斯 Let's put this to bed, Wes.
[36:04.59]韦伯肯定跟他谈了协议 Webb must have offered him a deal.
[36:06.36]那我们就提出更好的条件 Then we have to offer a better one.
[36:07.80]我猜是拨款委员会  我给不了更好的 I'm guessing appropriations. There's no way I can top that.
[36:10.58]除非是众议院税赋委员会 Except for ways and means.
[36:13.18]我不能让你把职位给巴克沃特这样的混蛋 I -- I won't let you give your chair to an ass like Buchwalter.
[36:17.97]如果你是党鞭 If you're the Whip,

[36:21.06]去他的委员会 Screw committees.
[36:21.82]我能直接跟议长交流 I'll have a direct line to the speaker.
[36:24.52]别固执了  杰姬 Don't be stubborn, Jackie.
[36:27.02]你觉得他会接受吗 You think he'd take it?
[36:28.22]他连韦伯的条件都愿意接受 He was willing to take a deal from Webb.
[36:30.23]但你是他最讨厌的人 But you're the only person he hates more.
[36:32.71]他很蛮人  但不是傻子 He's a brute. But he's not an idiot.
[36:44.76]我知道你不是出于忠诚而拒绝 Well, I know you're not refusing out of loyalty.
[36:46.95]没错 True.
[36:48.68]所以是泰德的缘故 So it's because of Ted.
[36:54.81]你觉得自己很厉害  对吧 You think you are hot shit, don't you?
[36:58.82]我们能放下架子  像成年人那样谈正经事吗 Can we set egos aside and talk business like the adults we are?
[37:05.05]我想要的不只是税赋委员会主席之位 I want more than ways and means.
[37:06.84]说吧 Tell me.
[37:08.20]我要哈维梅耶走人  不只是退休 I want Havemeyer gone. Not just retired....
[37:17.13]让他从政坛消失 Politically dead.
[37:19.58]竞选是12年前的事了 That race was 12 years ago.
[37:21.36]不是他  我也能当12年参议员了 That was 12 years I could have been in the Senate.
[37:24.54]你就想报复  真的吗 Revenge? Really?
[37:29.11]不是报复 Not revenge.
[37:32.75]是报应 Equity.
[37:36.44]那你准备怎么办 Well, what are you gonna do?
[37:37.66]巴克沃特不会让步的 Buchwalter won't budge.
[37:40.26]我这一生最鄙视小气之人 You know, there's nothing I despise more in life than pettiness.
[37:44.31]我可以去找韦伯  但我给不了他什么 I could approach Webb, but I don't have enough to offer him.
[37:46.80]他不会退选的  他自尊心太强 Ah, he'd never drop out. Too much pride.
[37:50.82]我不知道该怎么办 I'm not sure what to do.
[37:52.56]这是泰德的档案  他有个私生女 This is my file on Ted. An illegitimate daughter.

[38:07.84]这说来话长 It's complicated.
[38:09.13]私生女  我没看出有什么复杂的 The daughter? It's very black and white to me.
[38:13.05]我跟泰德是一辈子的交情 I've known Ted since I was born.

[38:22.23]我喜欢泰德  他一直都很有团队精神 I like Ted. He's always been a team player.
[38:24.22]很不幸  他拥有这样的秘密 It's unfortunate he has this secret.
[38:26.24]这是个错误  他一直都很后悔 It was a mistake. One he's always regretted.
[38:28.60]她出生之后  他让我去探望她 After she was born he asked me to check in on her,
[38:30.58]因为他自己做不到  而他信任我 because he couldn't. Because he trusted me.
[38:35.38]我懂了 I see.
[38:37.45]你来这里的时候就知道你该做什么 You came in here knowing what you had to do,
[38:40.53]但你还是希望我能变个戏法  你就不用那么做了 hoping I would pull a rabbit out of a hat so you wouldn't have to.

[38:50.25]你要如何决定是你自己的事 Whatever you decide is your prerogative.
[38:51.86]但也许我错看了你 But maybe I misjudged you.
[38:55.44]泰德对我来说就像家人一样 Ted is family to me.
[38:56.64]用来取代亲生女儿的养女 An adopted daughter in lieu of a real one.

[42:39.78]他向来不难收买 Well, he's always been the sort of man
[42:42.86]只是代价一直很大 who could be bought, but never cheaply.
