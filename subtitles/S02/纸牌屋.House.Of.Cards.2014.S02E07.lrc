[00:43.29]-超级政治行动委员会  -广告是攻击具体事件的 - Super PACs. - These are issue-based attack ads.
[00:45.54]钱是谁给的 So who's giving to them?
[00:46.50]得等这季财报才能确定来源 We can't trace the money until this quarter's filings come in.
[00:49.02]中期选举栽了  下次大选也泡汤了 We get killed in the midterms, we can kiss 2016 goodbye.
[00:51.90]共和党就会占据国会多数席位和白宫 You can deal with the republican majority and a Republican president.

[01:02.11]得切断他们的资金来源 We have to stop their money flow.
[01:03.49]怎么切 I want to know how.
[01:04.43]找到源头  釜底抽薪 Locate the source and then cut off the tap.

[01:39.79]真应该把你留在国会 I shoulda kept you in the house,
[01:41.08]向雷蒙德最初说的那样 like Raymond suggested from day one.
[01:43.45]可你分心去掺和参议院  国情咨文 But you've been distracted by the Senate, State of the Union,
[01:47.51]还干预外交 meddling with foreign diplomacy.
[01:48.60]-是您要我去谈判的  -我知道我做了什么 - You asked me to negotiate-- - I know what I've done.
[01:51.71]我也知道后果 And I know where it's gotten us.
[01:53.33]先生  攻击我们的广告不是因为 Sir, the attack ads are not a result of anything--
[01:55.70]你慌慌忙忙地到处扑火  而不是防止失火 You're scrambling from fire to fire instead of preventing them.
[01:59.22]我不是联邦选举委员会  不能变魔... I'm not the FEC, I can't wave a wand--
[02:01.62]别就知道找借口  弗兰克  你不止这点本事 Give me more than excuses, Frank! You're better than that!

[04:12.78]丹·拉尼根转投那边了 Dan Lanagin switched teams.
[04:16.18]这没道理啊 That doesn't make any sense.
[04:18.82]共和党的大捐助人都没什么异常 I couldn't find any anomalies among big Republican donors,
[04:22.44]于是我查了民主党的 so I checked our own.
[04:24.16]拉尼根这季一分都没捐 Lanagin hasn't given a dime this quarter.
[04:26.78]但没捐和资助共和党可不一样 Yeah, but not giving isn't the same as giving to the Republicans.
[04:30.44]他赌场的账目  安永事务所做的 His casino's accounts. Ernst and Young.
[04:34.41]捐了一千八百万  还不是给我们 Eighteen million for donations, and they're not going to us.
[04:38.55]你怎么弄到的 How did you get your hands on those?
[04:40.96]我有朋友  所以你才找我帮忙 I've got friends. That's why you solicit my services.
[04:44.49]那广告花了大约两千五百万 The estimate for the ad buys was 25 million.
[04:46.48]账目只到6月30日 Those accounts are up to date as of June 30th.

[05:00.92]雷蒙德·塔斯克吗 Raymond Tusk?
[05:02.39]他对我和总统有不满 He's got an axe to grind with me and with the president.
[05:05.66]选举委员会的文件里从未出现过他的名字 I've never seen his name on any FEC filings.
[05:07.98]他从不捐助政党 He doesn't make political contributions.
[05:09.76]所以才能进退自如 That's how he remains flexible.
[05:12.35]你觉得他在想办法筹集资金吗 You think he's funneling the money somehow?
[05:17.43]我不知道 I don't know.
[05:19.16]你去堪萨斯城  去那家赌场 Get yourself to Kansas City. I want you in that casino.
[05:21.61]-是  先生  -我会继续查的 - Yes, sir. - I'll keep digging.

[05:36.50]-这话不能上报纸吧  -我有办法 - I guess you can't print that. - I have ways.
[05:39.77]真的会上报纸吗 This really gonna be in the paper?
[05:41.48]至少能上波士顿的报纸 At least in Boston, yeah.
[05:43.43]我怎么觉得没人会在意 Don't see why anybody would care.
[05:45.61]这是关于个人喜好 Well, it's a personal interest story.
[05:49.05]那么多餐厅  美国副总统却偏偏喜欢这里 The vice president of the United States comes here, of all places.
[05:52.70]-你是说这破地方吗  -我可没这么说 - You mean this shithole? - That's not what I said.
[05:57.01]没关系 It's OK.
[05:59.34]又不是泰姬陵 It's not the Taj Mahal.
[06:02.02]他从什么时候开始来这里的 How long has he been coming?

[06:09.15]在这里  我才是总统 Hey, in this joint, I'm the president,
[06:10.73]是副总统  也是国会 the vice president and the Congress.
[06:12.65]他只是一名顾客  忠实的顾客 He just another customer. A loyal one.
[06:17.16]所以他才喜欢这里吗 You think that's why he likes it here?
[06:18.85]因为你像对待普通人那样对待他 'Cause you treat him like a regular person?
[06:20.99]也许吧  不过主要还是因为这肋排 Maybe. Mostly it's the fuckin' ribs, though.
[06:26.33]如果失业率上升至20%以上 Now, if unemployment goes up more than two-tenths,

[07:03.36]-就这样吗  -对 - That's it? - Yeah.
[07:06.31]-不要吃的吗  -不用  就这样 - Nothing to eat? - No. That's it.
[07:10.09]你要是在戒酒  在这地方待着可挺难熬的 Tough spot to hang out if you're in the program.
[07:13.26]-你怎么知道  -酒鬼眼里分外明 - How'd you know? - Takes one to know one, right?
[07:17.00]-你多久了  -刚过一年  你呢 - How long? - Little over a year. You?
[07:20.36]就要15年了 Going on 15.

[07:46.88]也没跟任何人说话吗 And he hasn't spoken to anybody?
[07:49.23]一直在赌 Just been betting on the races.
[07:51.46]要我们带他进来吗 You want us to bring him in?
[07:53.82]不  那是副总统的幕僚长 No. That's the vice president's chief of staff.
[07:58.26]真的吗 Really?
[08:00.09]别引发混乱  盯住他就行 We don't want to make a scene. Just keep an eye on him.
[08:04.36]告诉我他干了什么  去了哪里  跟谁说过话 Let me know what he does, where he goes, and who he talks to.
[08:09.44]明白  拉尼根先生 You got it, Mr. Lanagin.
[08:12.59]你真该看看他们的表情 You should've seen their faces.
[08:13.86]他们彻底糊涂了 They didn't know what to think.
[08:15.23]特别是我让他们扶住沙袋时 Especially when I made 'em hold the bag.
[08:17.01]您试过了吗 You tried it out?
[08:18.00]那是当然 I sure as hell did.
[08:22.84]很抱歉我那么冲你发脾气  弗兰克 I'm sorry I lashed out at you, Frank.
[08:24.34]不  是我失礼了  有失妥当 No. I was disrespectful, and that was uncalled for.
[08:26.98]我的情绪最近总有些失控 My temper's gotten away from me these days.
[08:29.71]我有时需要被人吼一吼  清醒过来 I need to be jolted back into reality sometimes.
[08:33.28]你是出于好意 It was a -- a kind gesture.
[08:34.96]就是消遣罢了 Oh, just some good old fun.
[08:38.57]特莉莎说我们这周要一起吃晚饭 Tricia tells me we're having dinner later this week.
[08:40.98]是的  克莱尔也这样跟我说 Yes. Claire tells me the same.
[08:42.66]能离开这里几小时也不错 Well, it'll be good to get out of this place for a few hours.
[08:55.87]这幅画从肯尼迪时期就挂在这里了 It's been here since Kennedy.
[08:57.48]是他出生那年画的 It was painted the same year he was born.
[08:59.88]描绘的好像是一战的庆祝游行 It depicts, I think, a World War I parade.
[09:04.41]每一幅画我都该了解一下 Oh, I should know every painting.
[09:07.41]您似乎懂不少呢  至少了解这幅 Well, you seem to know quite a lot, at least about this one.
[09:09.80]我想趁现在有机会  好好研究一下 Oh, I try to soak it all in while I can.
[09:12.45]所有的历史 All the history.
[09:15.03]痴迷于历史的总统 Presidents who obsess over history
[09:16.97]痴迷于他们在历史中的地位 obsess about their place in it,
[09:19.01]而不是如何创造历史 instead of forging it.
[09:21.64]谁说的 Who said that?
[09:23.35]我  就在刚才 I did. Just now.
[09:28.31]白宫  一整天都熙熙攘攘 Ah, the White House. All day long it's buzzing,
[09:31.39]这个时候却又如此冷清 and at this hour it's so desolate.
[09:36.12]做总统是件伟大而珍贵的事情 The presidency is a great and precious thing.
[09:40.19]而代价就是孤独 Loneliness is the price.
[09:43.36]做个假设 Let's assume
[09:47.13]如果杜鲁门总统就是坐在这其中一张椅子上 in one of these chairs, staring at this wall,
[09:50.95]盯着墙  决定投放核弹 is where Truman decided to drop the bomb.
[09:54.14]看看我们会不会有什么感觉 And see if we feel anything.

[11:47.64]有问题吗 Is that okay?
[11:49.43]不是我的风格 Not really my thing.
[11:52.75]得了吧  你肯定是老手了 Come on. You must play the field.
[11:55.27]不  我不是 No, I don't.
[11:57.69]但你很会调情啊 But you are such a flirt.
[11:59.25]我的确会调情 I flirt, yes.
[12:00.82]但我只跟喜欢的人上床 But I only sleep with someone if I'm into them.
[12:04.04]而且我喜欢留下过夜 And I prefer to stick around.
[12:06.35]雷米·丹顿  专情男子 Remy Danton, serial monogamist.

[12:37.59]每年三四次  会有十几个有钱的中国人飞过来 Three or four times a year they fly in about a dozen Chinese guys.
[12:40.77]专门来烧钱 Money to burn.
[12:42.18]他们把赌场一整层预留给他们 They got a whole floor of the casino reserved just for them.
[12:44.62]据说能输掉几百万 Word is they throw away millions.
[12:46.06]这说明不了什么 Well, that doesn't necessarily mean anything.
[12:47.77]中国人都爱赌博  特别是富人 The Chinese love to gamble. Especially the rich ones.
[12:50.44]没错  他们会去维加斯 Yeah, in Vegas.

[13:59.41]当然  我们肯定能拉来不少重量级人物 Absolutely. I'm sure we can lock down a lot of heavyweights.
[14:02.52]洛莉和我会处理这事 Lorrie and I will get right on it.

[14:06.21]-现在还太早了  -难道不该宣传吗 - It's premature for that. - Don't we want to get this out,
[14:08.16]尽早开始博取支持 start building support as soon as possible?
[14:09.96]-做活动和采访  -我只想看到最佳成效 - Events, interviews? - I want what's most effective.
[14:12.66]媒体大肆宣扬不好 A media blitz is the wrong way to go.
[14:14.25]应该始终只用一个引子 You want a single long lead
[14:15.56]与法案出台同步  要有档次 that coincides with the introduction of the bill. Something classy.
[14:18.03]-但要广泛支持才能...  -大肆宣传 - But you want broad support, to hit-- - A blanket strategy will
[14:20.63]能博取支持  但也可能招致批评 galvanize as many detractors as supporters.
[14:21.95]如果我们把理念包装得当... Not if the message is framed in such way--
[14:23.68]我们得先获取目标群体的认同  然后... We want a key demographic to get on board, and then--
[14:26.18]-请让我说完  -然后慢慢积累 - Let me finish, please. - Then we let it percolate.
[14:28.02]我建议找《纽约时代杂志》的马特·贝 I suggest Matt Bai, The New York Times Magazine.

[14:42.51]多谢了  杰姬 Thanks, Jackie.
[14:55.63]你读一下法案  给我写份摘要 I want you to read the bill and write me a summary.
[14:57.37]我们谈过之前  绝不要跟任何人透露一个字 Do not under any circumstances share it with anyone until we've spoken.
[15:01.48]你不先过一遍议员名单吗 You don't want to go over the board first, at least --
[15:02.55]不  不急 No. Not yet.
[15:12.44]关于堕胎查到了什么 Anything on the abortion?

[15:19.70]-安德伍德夫人说的是实话  -我们需要猛料 - Mrs. Underwood was telling the truth. - We need something.

[15:24.19]安德伍德夫妇都很小心 The Underwoods are careful.
[15:25.84]如果真有丑闻  肯定藏得非常深 If they have skeletons, they're buried deep.
[15:27.60]这不是"如果"的问题 Not a question of "If."
[15:28.49]弗兰克这样的人肯定有丑闻 Somebody like Frank is gonna have skeletons.
[15:31.21]那我会挖出来的 Then I'll find them.
[15:33.66]你这边一无所获  我就没法向上面交代 If you don't deliver, that means I don't deliver.
[15:35.78]那不是我的风格 And I always deliver.
[15:37.66]你给了我这个任务  而且期望我做好 You gave me an assignment with high expectations.
[15:40.09]我不会让你失望的  但也别指望一蹴而就 I will meet them. But it's not gonna happen overnight.
[15:43.03]所以别跟我颐指气使 So don't fuck with me.

[45:48.88]2010年以前  美国选举法规定 任何个人和组织向政治行动委员会捐款 每次选举不能超过5000美元 但是这个规定因为美国最高法院的一个判决而改变 2008年  美国前第一夫人希拉里作为候选人参加民主党总统初选 一个叫做"公民联合"的组织制作了一个攻击希拉里的纪录片打算在电视上播放 但地方法院裁定该纪录片性质上等同于竞选广告 在播出时间和制作费用上违反了选举法的有关规定 "公民联合"于是将此事诉诸最高法院 2010年1月  最高法院的9名法官以5比4的投票结果 裁定当时施行的相关选举法法规违宪 根据这个判决  美国的商业公司  工会组织和社会团体 向政治行动委员会捐款时  不应该有数额限制 超级政治行动委员会应运而生
[46:18.88]"Super PAC"是"独立支出政治活动委员会"的别称 在美国  候选人参加政治选举 或者一些社会机构想要对各级政府议会的立法行为进行影响和游说时 需要成立"政治委员会"来向社会募集资金 而这种独立的委员会之所以被媒体冠以"超级"的绰号 则是因为个人或机构向这种委员会进行捐款没有金额上限 在美国这样一个金钱和政治紧密难分的社会里 "无上限"的捐款  自然会带来"超级"的政治影响 "超级委员会"同普通政治行动委员会的不同之处还在于 该机构不能同其所支持的候选人进行沟通 亦不能在政治活动中进行协调 就是说  如果一个"超级委员会"支持某个共和党候选人 想要在报纸上登广告替该候选人宣传拉票 事先不能知会该候选人  而候选人也不能对广告内容发表意见
[46:48.88]2012年的共和党总统初选 是"超级委员会"首次登上全国性的政治舞台 根据美国联邦选举委员会公布的数据 在2012美国总统大选初选阶段 有近四百家"超级委员会"筹集了一亿多美元的竞选资金 针对2004年美国议会选举的一项统计结果显示 90%以上的选举中都是资金最多的候选人获胜 毫无疑问  在美国的政治制度中 金钱是一个不可或缺的基本元素 "超级委员会"便是这种金钱政治中最新出场的一支生力军
