[06:13.95]如果总统想参与这事 If the President had wanted to be involved,
[06:15.91]他早就打电话了 he would have already made that call.
[06:16.73]本来就是他的提议  琳达 It's his initiative, Linda.
[06:17.60]曾经是  但现在贸易战已经打响了 Was his initiative. We're in a trade war now.
[06:19.78]那也用不着把好端端的政策全丢掉 But that doesn't mean we have to abandon good policy.

[06:59.55]总统也非要这么想的话 and the president feels that strongly,
[07:01.01]那我就不管了 then I'll back off.

[07:08.44]非常赞同 I couldn't agree more.
[07:09.74]谢谢 Thank you.
[07:12.33]为什么凡事都这么不容易 Why does everything have to be a struggle?
[07:14.24]就没人能说一次"好"吗 Can't some people just say "Yes" for once?
[07:16.86]先生 Sir.
[07:18.11]我要总统明后天的日程表 I need the president's schedule for the next two days.

[07:35.18]多公开谈谈那事 If I talk about it more in the open.
[07:38.47]就像在你的访谈上那样 I mean that's what your interview did.
[07:40.91]我打进电话  公开说出那些事 When I called. When I could say those things out loud.
[07:43.61]我们不想让你觉得你有义务如此 Well, we don't want you to feel obligated.
[07:46.48]我知道媒体还一直缠着你 I know the press hasn't left you alone.
[07:49.74]如果他们还要继续给我拍照 If they're going to keep taking pictures of me,
[07:51.16]我至少该说点什么 I should at least say something.
[07:53.61]麦金尼斯上军事法庭指日可待 Well, that's only going to become more intense
[07:55.01]事态会越来越紧张 when McGinnis gets closer to his court-marshal.
[07:57.27]是啊  我知道 Yeah, I know.
[07:58.97]我准备好了 I'm prepared.
[07:59.85]如果你能去跟三军委员会谈谈 If you come and speak to the Armed Services Committee,
[08:02.45]说出你的往事 tell your story,
[08:03.61]那么法案一定能进入投票阶段 I feel confident we can get it to a vote.
[08:05.81]这样的重磅新闻他们不能无视 I'd be too much coverage to ignore it.
[08:07.47]你觉得法案会通过吗 And you think it will pass?
[08:08.40]要先要通过委员会 We need to get it through committee first.
[08:09.90]但我要说明  梅根 But let's be clear, Megan,
[08:11.06]你不光要举证 it's not just the testimony.
[08:12.79]稍后你还得面对媒体 We'll need you to do a media avail after.
[08:15.01]拍照片  做声明 Photo ops, a statement.

[08:26.58]你觉得这样做对吗 Do you think we're doing the right thing?
[08:28.38]把她拉到镜头前 Hauling her in front of the cameras?
[08:30.77]她说她想这样做  我们得相信她 We have to trust her when she says she wants to.
[08:34.12]但重要的是 But it's very important
[08:35.84]不仅是你  白宫也支持我们 that the White House backs us up on this, not just you.
[08:40.05]我不确定加勒特会不会公开表示支持 I'm not sure if Garrett will get involved publicly.
[08:43.28]你能和他谈谈吗 Well, can you talk to him?
[08:45.54]我们最近没怎么交谈 We haven't been doing much talking about anything lately.
[08:52.55]情况还没好转吗 Things haven't gotten any better?
[08:55.98]我们差不多一个礼拜没说过话了 We haven't said a word to each other in almost a week.

[09:11.23]不担心被曝光吗 Weren't you worried about exposure?
[09:13.15]他是个牧师 He was a minister.
[09:14.16]严格说  他不是心理咨询师 He wasn't exactly a therapist.
[09:15.73]更像是精神指引那种的 It was more like a spiritual guidance, type thing.
[09:20.35]唯一的区别是他有学位 The only difference was that he had a degree.
[09:23.87]我可以帮你联系 I could put you in touch.
[09:26.14]太冒险了 It's too risky.
[09:29.00]只是个建议而已 Just a suggestion.
[09:31.04]你要是改变主意就告诉我 Let me know if you change your mind.
[09:33.51]谢谢 Thanks.

[10:26.37]为什么晚上10点叫我过来 Why am I here at 10 at night?
[10:27.64]共和党的钱从哪来的 Where is the GOP getting their money?
[10:30.33]你是问那两千五百万吧 That is a $25 million question, isn't it?
[10:32.61]你一定知道 You must have an idea.
[10:33.77]你为什么会那么认为 What makes you think that?
[10:35.00]因为你无所不知 Because you know things.
[10:37.35]所以格兰顿-希尔升你做合伙人 That's why Glendon Hill made you partner.
[10:40.88]我们大部分客户都是民主党人 Most of our clients are Democrats.
[10:42.21]我和你一样毫不知情 I'm just as much in the dark as you are.
[10:45.70]我要失去我的选区了  雷米 I'm losing in my district, Remy.
[10:48.78]真希望我能帮你 And I wish I could help you.

[11:34.78]我在军队的时候  总是四处奔波 When I was in the army I was always on the move and, um...
[11:39.10]进入国会之后 Since I've been in Congress,
[11:40.15]又实在没有时间 I just haven't had time.
[11:42.49]我不是要你嫁给我 I wasn't asking to marry you.
[11:43.88]只是想比一夜情更认真一些 Just to be more than company for a night.
[11:48.73]你依然那么想吗 Do you still want that?
[11:51.17]我来了  不是吗 I'm here, aren't I?

[11:57.05]我们私底下的事 Whatever we have privately
[11:58.52]不能影响我们的公事关系 couldn't affect our professional relationship.

[12:13.43]很高兴我们能把话说开 I'm glad we had this meeting.
[12:16.27]如果你还想见我  给我打电话 If you'd like to have another, just call me.

[13:25.02]我在想中期选举的事 I'm thinking midterms.
[13:27.55]我们得表现出一致性 We have to project consistency.

[30:43.86]你的选择是错的  赛斯 You made the wrong choice, Seth.
[30:47.08]我不觉得 I don't think so.
[30:51.09]你什么也不是 You're nothing.
[30:52.69]就是只寄生虫 You're a parasite.
[30:53.92]你一样  丹顿 So are you Danton.

[31:36.59]我们撑得住 Nothing we can't weather.
[31:39.08]但我猜  他们是在虚张声势 But my bet is they're bluffing.
[31:41.25]只不过想吓唬我们 Just to make us paranoid.
[31:46.25]但他是个危险的人  不是吗  我是说雷蒙德 But he's a dangerous man, isn't he? Raymond?
[31:51.50]我们也可以很危险 We can be dangerous too.

[35:17.56]或六年 or six.
[35:19.96]就得做点什么 We need to do something.
[35:22.41]我们应该互相支持 We should be each others' support system.
[35:25.12]而不是互相施压 Not cause each other stress.
[35:28.09]白宫的基础不是砖瓦 The foundation of this White House is not brick and mortar.
[35:31.84]而是我们啊  加勒特 It's us, Garrett.
[35:38.43]这对我很重要 This is important to me.
[35:40.98]我希望你也能重视 And I want it to be important to you.

[35:54.17]既不会让我有危险 that I'm neither at risk,
[35:55.35]也不会让我被动地纵容明显的违法行为 nor passively condoning something blatantly illegal.
[35:58.06]所有风险都是我一人承担 Any risk solely falls on me,
[36:00.30]你不知情  也不能被指责纵容 and you can't be accused of condoning what you're not aware of.
[36:03.04]不知情也一样糟糕 Being not aware is just as egregious.
[36:04.90]在这件事上不是 Not in this case.
[36:06.10]我正在想办法避开麻烦 I'm steering the ship away from the rocks,
[36:07.77]而不是迎头撞上 not toward them.

[36:22.46]我很生她的气 I was furious with her.
[36:24.17]这招让我很被动 That was a very manipulative move.
[36:27.11]我能猜到她为什么这么做 I can speculate as to why she made it.
[36:29.30]她的不满有道理吗 Are her complaints valid?
[36:32.10]我对这个问题的看法很主观 I have a very biased view on that subject.
[36:34.66]我已经听过她的想法了 Well, I've heard hers.
[36:36.14]说说你的吧 Give me yours.
[36:38.81]琳达和我时不时会有争执 Linda and I don't always agree.

[36:42.50]是一名非常得力的幕僚长 and a more than competent Chief of Staff.
[36:45.20]你觉得我该挽留她吗 So you think I should keep her?
[36:49.07]我觉得她有时会管太宽吗 Do I think she oversteps sometimes?
[36:51.13]没错 Yes.
[36:52.07]她错以为自己的意见和我的一样重要吗 Does she wrongly equate her advice with mine?
[36:54.60]常有的事 Often.
[36:55.25]但是  我想到问题不在于琳达 But... the question that occurs to me is not about Linda.
[36:59.79]就算你回绝了她的辞呈 Let's say you refuse her resignation,
[37:01.79]消息很有可能传出去 if this gets out, and it could,
[37:04.59]这样所有为你的工作的人  不是都会觉得 won't you be sending a signal to anybody who works for you that...
[37:09.19]他们可以跟你谈判 ...you can be leveraged.

[38:21.82]我理解你  没关系 I understand, it's OK.
[38:23.22]但你要是现在退缩  梅根 But if you back out now, Megan...
[38:24.48]这根本不是为我  对吧 This isn't about me at all, is it?
[38:25.51]对我们会很不好  有损我们的形象 ...this is not good for us. It hurts us,
[38:26.98]让人觉得我们很松散 it makes us look unorganized.
[38:27.81]这他妈是你亮相的机会 This is about your fucking moment to shine.
[38:29.63]你根本不在乎我怎么样 You don't fucking care if do...
[38:31.26]我在乎  真心在乎 I do care. I do care.

[41:05.58]我提到了你的忠诚 I did bring up your loyalty
[41:06.88]以及你出色的工作 and how good you are at your job.

[41:54.50]但没把我当过朋友 I've never been that to him.
[41:55.71]但是他的工作超过友谊 But his job is bigger than friendship.

[44:46.75]床单下的安德伍德夫人  和摄影家亚当·嘉乐威的私情
[44:54.35]■ 琳达所担任的白宫幕僚长是美国联邦政府内一个非常重要的职务 在白宫内可谓"一人之下  万人之上"  不仅直接对总统负责 管理白宫内其他所有雇员  担任着"大内总管"的角色 同时也是总统应对危机  制定政策时最依赖的顾问和心腹 奥巴马上任五年  白宫内迎来过五位幕僚长 首任幕僚长伊曼纽是奥巴马在芝加哥的老乡  曾在克林顿政府任职 据说美剧《白宫风云》中乔什·莱曼的角色就是以伊曼纽为原型 他也是奥巴马白宫迄今为止最有影响力的一名幕僚长 正是在他的努力推动下 奥巴马才得以在入主白宫后不久就通过了全民医保法案 伊曼纽担任幕僚长两年后"告老还乡"  回芝加哥担任市长 此后几名幕僚长都没有太大的影响力
[45:19.35]■ 2013年叙利亚危机期间 美国政府一度打算用武力打击阿萨德政府 但是奥巴马对是否动武一直犹豫不决 一天晚餐后  他同现任幕僚长麦当诺在白宫草坪散步45分钟 散步结束  奥巴马连夜召开会议  决定放弃直接武装打击的策略 转而寻求国会授权  武力干预叙利亚的决定最终被搁置
[45:34.35]■ 美国土着印第安人占美国总人口的1.2% 他们对其所居住的保留地享有一定程度的自主权 1976年美国最高法院裁定地方政府无权干涉印第安人对保留地的开发使用 随后大量赌场开始在印第安保留地出现 虽然美国各州政府一度试图对赌场进行限制 但是1988年美国国会通过的《印第安赌博管理法案》 正式承认了印第安人在保留地上开设赌场的权利 由于法案规定只有传统的印第安部落才有资格进行赌场运营 所以1988年之后  出现了大量要求印第安人事务局进行认证的部落 目前美国有326个印第安保留地  约500多个被认证的部落 其中240个部落经营着460间赌场  每年赌场收入高达270亿美元
[45:59.35]■ 虽然开设赌场为印第安部落带来巨额收益 但是目前美国印第安人的整体经济状况仍然很差 印第安家庭年平均收入约为3万8千美元 远远低于美国整体平均收入(5万1千美元)
