[01:32.65]纸牌屋 第五季  第三集
[01:51.81]我找不到合适的语言形容那天发生的事 I don't have the right words for what happened that day.
[01:54.73]但毋庸置疑他是位英雄 But he was a hero, no question.
[01:56.90]康威上尉的行为是英勇的 Captain Conway's conduct was heroic.
[01:59.40]一位英雄 A hero.
[02:00.79]塔利班劫持了陆军上尉克雷格·斯夸尔 Army Captain Craig Squire had been captured by the Taliban,
[02:03.38]他被关在坎大哈省 held hostage in the Kandahar province.

[02:20.99]是选弗兰西斯·安德伍德 You have a choice between Francis Underwood
[02:23.99]还是选真正的英雄 and a real hero.

[02:42.09]我不知道我们得说多少遍 I don't know how many times I have to go through this,
[02:43.69]但我的竞选团队跟那条广告一点关系都没有 but my campaign had nothing to do with that ad.
[02:45.53]是超级政治行动委员会做的 That was a super PAC.
[02:46.81]-我知道  但是  -但那些士兵 - I know, but-- - But those soldiers, though.
[02:49.22]他们才是英雄 They're the ones.
[02:50.81]这个国家欠他们太多了 This country owes them a lot.
[02:52.56]-但那条广告成天在播  -你想知道原因吗 - But that ad is on all the time. - You wanna know why?

[04:09.94]知道贿赂的事也没关系 if Underwood knew about pay-for-play?
[04:11.84]我是说  那无论如何都不好 Well, I'm saying it's bad either way.
[04:15.20]他要么是从他自己党派的人那儿偷来了总统之位 He either stole the presidency from his own party,
[04:18.81]要么是在腐败的政府中做了副总统 or he was vice president in a corrupt administration.

[08:18.67]他们朝我身上扔尸体  一个接一个 They were tossing bodies on top of me, one after the other...
[08:21.99]我死定了 I was already dead.
[08:24.12]不对  就好像我已经死了一次 That's not right. It's like I've been dead once already.
[08:27.97]但那些尸体  就那么堆在一起 But the bodies... the way they were stuck together.
[08:30.57]又那么热  还有味道 And the heat and the smell...
[08:32.70]但你还记得你把我拉出来的时候吗 But you know when you were pulling me out, remember?

[09:08.14]他说的程度还不够  他没让康威... He didn't call him out enough. He didn't get Conway to--
[09:10.31]听着  他尽力了 Look... he did what he could.
[09:14.93]他听到了什么  他那是什么意思 What did he hear? What did he mean by that?
[09:17.34]不知道  那是威尔和他之间的事 I don't know. It's between Will and him.
[09:18.84]他早就想让威尔出来说清楚了  不过 He's wanted Will to come clean about it for a long time, but...
[09:22.60]没能如愿 it didn't happen.
[09:24.51]所以  看在克雷格的分上 Which is why, for Craig's sake,
[09:26.13]我们得让他们再连线一次 we need to get them back on the phone.
[09:27.94]哈维小姐  你跟了我们几个月了 Miss Harvey, you've been on us for months.

[10:19.30]我们今晚可以调出一些带子  拼凑点什么出来 We can pull some tape and put something together tonight.
[10:22.17]明早上放出来 Hit some markets in the morning.
[10:24.94]等到了投票的时候 When it's time to vote...

[10:41.77]我做这行很久了  汉娜 I've been at this a long time, Hannah.
[10:44.17]知道吗  当马歇尔告诉我你有空时 You know, when Marshall told me you were available--
[10:46.22]马歇尔和我是老相识了 Marshall and I go way back.
[10:48.23]这时机对我们所有人都合适  对吗 The timing is right for all of us, right?
[10:51.93]我们非常感激 We're very grateful.
[10:52.73]那他就会告诉你  我通常不会 Then he will tell you, I don't get involved,
[10:54.45]在这么晚的时候插进来 not this late in the game, unless
[10:56.51]除非我知道我能发挥影响 I know I can make a difference.
[11:01.23]所以不管威尔和斯夸尔发生了什么 So whatever happened to Will with Squire, whatever...
[11:03.61]-不是  -我不想知道  也不需要知道 - It's not-- - I don't wanna know. I don't need to know.
[11:07.86]但不管那些事让他承受着怎样的痛苦 But whatever pain he's carrying about what happened...
[11:12.35]对我们是有利的 it's working for us.
[11:14.67]所以  我需要你 So, this is what I need from you.
[11:17.25]回去那里 To go back out there
[11:18.76]确保他能撑到明早 and just make sure he makes it through until morning.
[11:30.85]他有机会做一个好总统 He has a chance to be a fine president.
[11:33.62]一个伟大的总统 A great president.
[11:38.39]那更好了 Even better.
[11:42.28]因为我们需要这样的总统 Because we could use one.
[11:47.30]斯夸尔没出现在那广告里是有原因的 There's a reason that Squire didn't appear in that ad.
[11:51.04]我还在确认细节 I'm just nailing down the specifics.
[11:56.99]-让道格加入吧  -他在去费城的路上 - Let's bring Doug in on this. - He's on his way to Philly.
[11:59.74]而且恕我直言  先生 And with all due respect, sir,
[12:01.89]他的技能在这里并不适用 his skill set doesn't necessarily apply here.
[12:05.98]你知道道格跟我多久了吗  莉安 Do you know how long Doug has worked for me, LeAnn?
[12:08.39]不太清楚 Not exactly, no.

[12:28.35]-我很坦诚的  -我根本不信 - I'm pretty straightforward. - I don't believe that for a second.
[12:31.86]我第一次跟道格坐下来谈 The first time I sat down with Doug,
[12:33.80]更像是他的坦白而非对话 it was more of a confession than a conversation.
[12:36.71]他跟我说了他酗酒的事  他的过去 He told me about his drinking, his past.
[12:39.14]他对我彻底敞开了心扉 He was completely open with me.
[12:42.31]我不觉得我们能指望克雷格·斯夸尔 I don't think we can rely on Craig Squire.
[12:44.58]那我们还有什么好说的 Then why am I still talking to you?
[12:47.64]我没有掩饰内心  先生 I'm not hiding the contents of my soul, sir.
[12:51.31]去找凡妮莎·莫里森 Reach out to Vanessa Morrison.

[13:02.00]关于接下来的演讲 And in terms of what comes next,
[13:03.70]我调整了开场白  缩减了正文的篇幅 I adjusted the opening remarks and cut some from the stump.
[13:07.01]正文不用改了 The stump is just fine.
[13:08.28]非常感谢 Thank you very much.

[13:21.94]喂 Hello.
[13:22.84]我们身边的人知道风险有多大吗 Do the people around us understand what it takes?
[13:26.59]我知道康威的声势起来了 Look, I know Conway's getting a bump,
[13:28.74]但这不代表接下来的一天里我们不能扳回来 but it doesn't mean we can't surmount it in the next 24 hours.
[13:31.67]他们知道我们付出了多少才走到今天 Do they know what we have done to get this far?
[13:36.72]汤姆现在就坐在我对面 Tom is sitting across from me right now.
[13:38.88]我才不管你对面坐着谁  克莱尔 I don't care who you're sitting next to, Claire.

[13:55.74]-我们20分钟到斯克兰顿  -你得养养嗓子 - We, uh... We're in Scranton in 20. - You need to save your voice.
[14:03.03]我们战场上见 I'll see you on the battlefield.
[14:14.95]总统怎么样 How's the President doing?
[14:18.86]他还把自己当个年轻人 He's acting like he's still 30 years old.
[14:26.27]我们都是 We both are.
[14:29.26]这是好事  还是坏事 Is that good... or bad?
[14:34.99]得看我们是输是赢了 That depends on if we win or lose.

[22:50.47]在选举日当天逮捕穆罕默德·卡拉比 To arrest Muhammed Kalabi on election day?
[22:53.15]凯茜  要是他告诉当局 Cathy, what's gonna happen
[22:54.52]他不是恐怖分子怎么办 when he tells the authorities he's the wrong one?

[24:27.52]但如果有别的办法呢 But what if there was another way?
[24:31.23]我敢说  如果大家都坦诚面对自己 I don't think anybody, if they're honest with themselves,
[24:34.08]没有一个人会说他真的信任安德伍德总统 can say they truly trust President Underwood.
[24:37.58]凭什么要信任他 Why should they?
[24:39.48]我们国家面临了如此多的威胁 With so many threats to our country,

[29:10.68]我不相信民调 Oh, I don't trust the polls.
[29:13.91]除了极少数外  我不相信任何人或任何事 With few exceptions, I don't trust anyone or anything.
[29:21.82]投票没开始前一切都是未知的 We won't know for sure until the vote's begun.
[29:25.98]但他们的投票率肯定会降低的 But turnout for their side is sure to be down.
[29:31.49]我们今天差点就打败康威了 We almost had Conway today.
[29:36.39]但我们确实伤到了他 And we did some damage.
[29:39.14]或许我们不知道他在隐瞒什么 And maybe we don't know what he's hiding,
[29:41.89]但公众知道他有所隐瞒 but the public knows there's something out there.
[29:58.47]他睡觉有时会哼歌 He hums in his sleep sometimes.
