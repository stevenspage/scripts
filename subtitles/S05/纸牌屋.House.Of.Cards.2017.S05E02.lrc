[16:48.05]我们在关注亨特顿  埃尔科  杰弗逊郡 We're keeping an eye on Hunterdon, Elko, Jefferson counties.
[16:51.53]还有切斯特和麦克亨利 Also Chester and McHenry.
[16:54.56]所以在大选来临前 Which is why it's crucial
[16:55.86]我们必须要与你们各州的 that we work with your states' administrations
[16:57.41]州政府合作 leading up to the election.
[16:59.55]这些选区 Every one of those precincts
[17:00.71]都是典型的共和党票仓 is a typically Republican stronghold.
[17:03.43]这和党派关系无关 This isn't about party affiliation.
[17:05.80]如总统所说  这事关国家安全 As the president said, this is about security.
[17:10.23]我们相信这些举措 Now, we believe this course of action,
[17:12.65]对投票站增加警力 the voting centers with the added law enforcement,
[17:15.14]能充分保证 will give us everything that we need
[17:16.99]选举的安全性 to protect the integrity of the ballot box.
[17:18.46]好吧  但我代表 Okay, but speaking for
[17:19.49]奥姆斯泰德州长  也许还有所有我们的上司 Governor Olmstead and maybe all of our bosses,
[17:22.06]想问问  我们怎么知道这些措施 how can we be sure that these measures
[17:23.26]不会让选民不敢去投票 won't discourage everyone from getting to the polls?
[17:25.91]-比如  民主党人  -我们必须冒这个险 - I.E., Democrats. - It's a chance we have to take.
[17:29.82]但我们认为不会出现这样的结果 But we don't believe it'll play out that way.
[17:31.13]我们俄亥俄州的选票非常接近 We're in an extremely close race in Ohio.
[17:33.80]重要的是预防可能的 Preventing further acts of terrorism
[17:35.30]恐怖袭击  塔妮娅 is just about all that matters, Tanya.
[17:37.63]我非常清楚  威胁的增加 Now, I do realize with these heightened threats
[17:41.78]给了你们的州长额外的压力 comes an additional strain on the governors of your states.
[17:44.52]所以... So...
[17:47.24]我要对你们所有人说... I say to each and every one of you...
[17:50.52]告诉我们该如何帮助你们 tell me how we can help.
[17:52.19]抛开确实存在的道德问题不谈 Putting aside the very real moral questions,
[17:55.81]封锁边境怎么能可行 how is shutting down the borders even feasible?
[18:00.13]我知道这项政策会损害部分人的利益 I know this policy is going to hurt some people,
[18:05.30]但容我解释一下为什么必须这样做 but let me explain why it's necessary.
[18:12.10]副总统随时可以补充 And the vice president should feel free to jump in.
[18:18.06]好玩吗 But is it fun?
[18:19.93]为安德伍德找话说 Putting words in the Underwoods' mouths?
[18:22.16]我的工作不是这样的 That's not what I do.
[18:24.94]恰好相反 It's more like the opposite.
[18:28.02]我只是尽量表达出... I just try and articulate...
[18:30.35]他们的想法和心声 what's on their minds and in their hearts.
[18:33.74]你是这么看待你的工作的 That's how you see your job?
[18:36.77]基本上  我的工作就是当个隐形人 Basically, my job is to remain invisible.
[18:41.59]那晚上你和他们在一起吗 Were you with them that night?
[18:42.90]吉姆·米勒被杀的那晚 The night Jim Miller was killed?
[18:46.62]这我不能回答 I'm not gonna answer that.
[18:48.34]那就当作默认 I'll take that as a "yes."
[18:50.07]别这样 Don't.
[18:52.07]我只是想了解你的工作 I'm just trying to understand what you do.
[18:53.64]那你就弄错重点了 Then you're missing the point.
[18:55.76]我不是主角  史蒂夫  我不是 I'm not the story, Steve. I'm just not.
[19:03.17]你把自己说得可有可无 You make yourself sound replaceable.
[19:10.03]事实如此 I am.
[19:11.42]-我为总统效劳  -还有第一夫人 - I serve at the pleasure of the president. - And the First Lady?
[19:15.58]民主党副总统候选人 The Democratic vice presidential candidate...
[19:18.78]没错  还有她 Yeah. Her, too.
[19:20.88]但你为他们俩撰写讲稿 But you write speeches for both of them?
[19:23.91]更多是为安德伍德夫人写 Most often for Mrs. Underwood.
[19:26.25]将她的想法和心声表达出来 Articulating what's on her mind and in her heart?
[19:32.03]我只是个传声筒 I'm just a mouthpiece.
[19:35.29]她有交给你其他"任务"吗 Has she put you in charge of any other parts?
[19:42.17]你还是那么混账 You're still an asshole, man.
[19:46.90]祝你赡养费的事好运 Good luck with the alimony.
[20:02.35]-真够呛  -还算顺利吧 - That was rough. - It went fine.
[20:04.90]这维系不下去的 It's not sustainable.
[20:07.51]你的看法是什么 I mean, what do you think?
[20:10.47]-什么的看法  -总统急于宣战之举 - About what? - About the president's rush to war.
[20:14.80]华府至少有一半人都认为这太过分了 At least half the Beltway seems to think it's outrageous.
[20:17.77]是很过分 It is outrageous.
[20:20.44]我们可以辞职以表示抗议 We could resign our posts, you know, in protest.
[20:25.66]我相信我们能说服其他内阁成员一起辞职 I bet we can convince others of the cabinet to do the same thing.
[20:28.65]我是想说  目的就是要过分 Outrageous by design, I was going to say.
[20:30.74]总统的做法很聪明 It's smart, what the president's doing.
[20:33.13]-为他的民调加了分  -唐纳德 - It's serving him in the polls. - Donald.
[20:37.15]我们先...退几步说话 Let's... take a step back for a moment.
[20:41.44]我低估了你  真的 I underestimated you. I did.
[20:44.36]你当代总统时  我对你信心不足 When you were acting president, my faith was less than full.
[20:47.16]但现在我能理解你当时的困境和压力... But now, I understand the terrible box you were in, the forces--
[20:51.07]凯茜  我得...打断你 Cathy, I'm gonna... I'm gonna stop you.
[20:53.57]我真的不知道你在说些什么 I honestly don't know what you're talking about.
[20:56.94]你是说你的计划是要 Are you telling me your plan
[20:58.24]装作若无其事直到1月20日总统就职吗 is just to phone it in until January 20th?
[21:03.86]唐纳德  你是怎么回事 Come on, Donald. What's happened to you?
[21:09.18]想当初 Back in the day,
[21:09.88]你和玛乔莉总是站在 you and Marjorie were at
[21:10.86]所有进步革新的最前线 the forefront of every progressive cause,
[21:13.07]真正地为善而战 literally fighting the good fight.
[21:14.93]这些人 These people...
[21:17.98]我们真要让他们这么做吗 Can we really let them do this?
[21:20.70]你想缅怀往事  凯茜  好吧 You wanna walk down memory lane, Cathy? Okay.
[21:24.59]记得党代会吗  记得政治新闻网那篇文章吗 Remember the convention? Remember the Politico article?
[21:27.53]我给了你一条退路 I offered you an out.
[21:29.59]你当时就该把握机会下台 You should've taken that opportunity to resign, then and there.
[21:33.15]-当时的情况和现在不同  -没两样 - Circumstances were nothing like this. - Sure they were.
[21:37.19]你当时只是不愿认清事实 You just didn't want to see it.
[21:39.65]再告诉你一件事 And, just so you know,
[21:41.68]在她完全失智前  玛乔莉就说准了 right before her mind was truly gone, Marjorie called it.
[21:44.94]她看出了你和弗兰克·安德伍德的私下结盟 She saw the unholy alliance you were making with Frank Underwood.
[21:48.92]她早就说准了 She called it.
[22:06.57]今天我们俩上司的会面... So this meeting between our bosses today...
[22:10.40]总统期待 The president is looking forward to
[22:11.35]与马修斯州长展开有成效的会谈 a productive discussion with Governor Matthews.
[22:13.36]这里只有我们俩  咱就别说废话了 There's no one else here. Can we cut the crap?
[22:15.48]你要我们刻意压制投票 You want us to engage in voter suppression.
[22:26.57]我不会用那样的字眼 It's not a phrase I'd ever use.
[22:28.05]随便你  那就称之为"降低动力"吧 Fine. Call it "motor depression" for all I care.
[22:30.60]我们懂的  白人是问题所在 We get it. White people are the problem.
[22:32.68]是共和党人  我懂 Republicans. Understood.
[22:34.65]但我的上司并不参加再选 But my boss doesn't happen to be up for reelection.
[22:39.14]我洗耳恭听 I'm listening.
[22:41.14]我就说三个字  "熔渣堆" I have two words for you. "Slag heap."
[22:44.00]马修斯希望环保署把费城郊区 Matthews wants the EPA to name a slag heap
[22:46.25]一座熔渣堆列为特别清污地点 on the outskirts of Philadelphia as a Superfund site.
[22:48.95]我高度怀疑这在大选前能实现 I seriously doubt that can happen before the election.
[22:51.13]你该克服自我怀疑  道格 I think you should battle your doubts, Doug.
[22:53.82]州长愿意让过去成为往事 The governor is willing to let the past stay in the past.
[22:56.52]但除非安德伍德政府 But unless the Underwood administration
[22:58.15]备好了上等大礼 is bearing top-tier gifts,
[22:59.38]你敢让前副总统帮忙 you've got a lot of fucking nerve
[23:00.76]胆子还真是够大 asking for favors from the former VP.
[23:03.68]但话说回来  如果你能把事情处理好 On the other hand, if you make things right,
[23:06.28]马修斯会做好他该做的 Matthews will do his part.
[23:09.91]你应该一向很同情那匹马吧 Don't you always feel sorry for the horse?
[23:48.94]会议室里是谁 Who's in the conference room?
[23:50.56]-你是说娘子军吗  -什么 - You mean the lady brigade? - What?
[23:53.30]就是国安局的法庭审计员 That's what they call the NSA forensic auditors.
[23:57.99]我不知道她们今天要来 Yeah, I... I didn't know they were scheduled for today.

[24:03.54]国安局就这样 Welcome to the NSA.

[24:35.45]放着就是让人吃的 Well, that's what they're there for.
[24:37.63]我不会占用你太多时间 I won't take up much of your time.
[24:39.13]我知道你下午很忙 I know you have a busy afternoon.
[24:41.29]-我还是有点时间的  -我很好奇 - Well, I've got a little time. - I'm curious.
[24:45.09]为什么委员会先给你打电话 Why do you think the committee decided to call you first?
[24:49.99]因为是我要求的 Because I asked them to.
[24:53.57]突然要参加 Well, this emergency
[24:55.18]你召开的紧急州长会议  所以... governors' conference of yours came up and, uh...
[24:58.73]你肯定记得  我不怎么喜欢特区 I'm sure you recall, I don't much like DC,
[25:00.79]所以我想着何不就一次都搞定呢 so I figured why not make it one-stop shopping?
[25:04.29]是啊 Yes.
[25:05.67]不过我们都知道  行使总统特权 But, of course, we both know that executive privilege
[25:09.62]就可以替你省一桩事的 could've negated your having to appear at one of those shops.
[25:16.13]吉姆 Jim?
[25:18.16]我会帮你解决熔渣堆的事 I'm going to help you with your slag heap.
[25:20.76]希望这样一来我能指望上你 I hope that means that I can count on you.
[25:24.36]当然了 Of course that's what it means.
[25:26.80]我们是一个小型兄弟会的  都是前副总统 We're members of a tiny brotherhood, you and I, of ex-VPs.
[25:32.70]如果加勒特·沃克去委员会作证 When, and if, Garrett Walker appears before this committee,
[25:35.20]你觉得他会... do you think he'll...
[25:38.02]-背叛党派吗  -你是说背叛你吗 - betray the party? - You mean you?
[25:43.17]两者是一回事 Well, that would be the same thing.
[25:45.82]我不知道你接替了我副总统的职位 Now, I don't know what really happened
[25:49.52]随后又接替了加勒特总统的职位过程中 on your journey to replace me as vice president
[25:51.95]究竟发生了什么 and then Garrett as president.
[25:54.69]我只知道自己的直觉 I only know what my gut tells me.
[25:57.91]但我愿意无视我的直觉 But I'm willing to say fuck my gut.
[26:06.97]总而言之 Bottom line is
[26:08.40]我能帮你搞定委员会  也能伤害你 I can help you with this committee or I can hurt you.
[26:12.46]我可以说我一无所知 Now, I can say that I know nothing...
[26:18.05]我认为加勒特·沃克是个有困扰的人 and that what I saw in Garrett Walker was a troubled man.
[26:21.71]我可以只说这些 And I can leave it at that.
[26:29.30]你觉得呢 What do you think?
[26:32.40]我不能告诉你该怎么做  吉姆 Oh, I can't tell you what to do, Jim.
[26:36.01]但我可以说  我们副总统不说两家话 But I can say, as one ex-VP to another,

[40:58.21]不过在华盛顿 But, of course, here in Washington,
[40:59.99]手边有什么垃圾都得拿来用 we have to use whatever garbage we find lying around.
[41:02.69]委员会将就安德伍德的 宣战请求举办听证会
[41:04.25]但如果利用不好手边... But then, if a man cannot use what's right in...
[41:14.57]该死  蒂姆 God damn it, Tim.
[41:23.43]如果你不够聪明 If a man is not smart enough
[41:24.60]利用不好手边的资源 to be able to use whatever is in front of him
[41:27.67]办不成事 and still make it work...
[41:30.66]那就是 well, then...

[44:41.81]国民警卫队的巡逻 National Guard on patrol
[44:42.97]会让我们在选举前显得软弱  不行 makes us look weak right before an election. Forget it.
[44:45.38]-但州长  -我已经决定了  塔妮娅 - But, Governor-- - I made my decision, Tanya.

[48:12.37]然后他们会反思自己的失职  并采取行动 after which they will reconsider their paralysis and choose to act.

[48:18.95]无信号

[49:05.55]你那天很英勇  你应该利用起来  威尔 You were a hero that day. You should use it, Will.
[49:14.92]州长  恐怖分子正在袭击 Governor, aren't you worried about
[49:15.93]难道你带孩子们出门不会担心吗 bringing your kids out in the middle of a terrorist attack?
[49:18.98]让孩子在家里更可怕 It'd be scarier to keep the kids at home.
[49:21.24]街头很安全  生活得继续 The streets are safe. Life goes on.
[49:27.39]在开玩笑吧 You've got to be kidding me.

[50:06.62]全都乱作一团 All hell breaks loose.
[50:19.95]压制投票的问题是近些年美国两党分歧较大  斗争激烈的一个政治议题 这个问题的核心是  共和党主张为了防止选举舞弊 应该在投票时要求选民出示有效的身份证件  但是民主党认为 由于民主党选民大多生活窘困  办理驾照或身份证件很困难 所以要求出示身份证件  实际上就是要阻止底层选民投票 而共和党反过来指控民主党这种立场是鼓励有利于自己的非法移民投票 这一问题在美国多地引发了多起高调的诉讼 一般是一些共和党占多数的州议会和政府出台相关法律 要求投票时出示证件  然后支持民主党的民权组织提起诉讼 称这种法律违宪  目前美国有多个州的选民证件法面临法律挑战 其它压制投票的方法还有减少投票点  缩短提前投票时间等
