[19:17.65]《来世: 我们留下的》 "The Life After: What We Leave Behind."
[19:21.97]但愿你会出席 Hope you'll be there.
[19:28.75]你闻闻 Smell that.
[19:31.04]高斯巴雪茄 Cohiba.
[19:33.65]我知道你很喜欢 I know you're a fan.
[19:36.14]虽然我不抽了  但不代表我不能... Even though I don't smoke anymore, doesn't mean I can't--
[19:39.26]谁组织的这周末的聚会  你吗 Who called this weekend's gathering? You?
[19:41.40]不是  是塔斯克 No. Tusk did.
[19:45.85]怎么 Why?
[19:49.70]我们觉得中国人说得对  船上的确有一位美国人 We think the Chinese are right. There is an American on board.
[19:52.22]考察船
[19:53.13]这是撒德·彼得森  两年前退休了 This is Thad Peterson. Retired two years ago.
[19:56.77]地球物理研究主任 Director of geophysics research
[19:58.45]在美国几家顶尖石油公司供职 for some of the country's top oil companies.
[20:00.40]我们强烈怀疑他在那艘船上 We strongly suspect he's on board the boat.
[20:02.34]正在和俄罗斯人合作 Working with the Russians.
[20:06.24]证据呢 Where's the proof?
[20:07.93]这是通讯中断前 This was sent from a Russian sailor's cell phone
[20:10.24]俄罗斯船员的手机发出的 before communications were cut off.
[20:15.39]打开无线电求救 Get on the radio and call for help!
[20:18.89]他的妻子确认 His wife confirmed that
[20:19.79]录音里就是撒德·彼得森的声音 this is Thad Peterson's voice on the recording.
[20:22.90]24小时后  最多36小时  那艘船就会沉 In 24, 36 hours tops, that boat's gone.
[20:28.10]对  但那不能证明撒德·彼得森在船上 Yes, but that doesn't prove that Thad Peterson was on the ship.
[20:34.54]但女士  他是美国人 But, ma'am... he is an American--
[20:37.19]不  我们不能确定  除非有乘客名单 No, we can't be sure until we have a passenger manifest.
[20:41.06]等有更多信息再开会 Let's reconvene when you know more.
[20:50.29]-怎么了  凯茜  -你决定不干预 - What is it, Cathy? - Your decision not to intervene.
[20:54.36]如果有美国人在非法工作 If an American is working illegally,
[20:56.05]他不会出现在名单上 he will not be on the manifest--
[20:57.86]我还没做决定  我在等更多信息 I haven't made a decision. I'm waiting for more information.
[21:02.03]这关系到了艾丹·麦卡伦 This is about Aidan Macallan.
[21:05.89]我非常确信 I am very confident
[21:07.44]中国谎称有美国人在船上 China is lying about an American being on board.
[21:10.21]船上有他们想要的东西 There is something on that boat they want
[21:12.21]得等我知道是什么再说 and I can't proceed until I know what it is.
[21:14.83]他们说自己的动机是救人 They say they're motivated by saving human lives.
[21:18.15]但那不是他们的真实动机 But that's not what's driving them.
[21:20.67]我只是觉得难以接受 And I just find it so frustrating
[21:22.25]人命受到如此漠视 when human life is treated with such disregard.
[21:27.33]抱歉  但... We're sorry. But...
[21:29.97]俗话说的"林间漫步"不适合我 The proverbial walk in the woods is not for me.
[21:32.87]在林荫小径寻寻觅觅 Navel-gazing on some forest path.
[21:35.74]思考死亡与永生 Contemplating mortality. Immortality.
[21:39.54]才不  历史要去争取 No. History is earned.
[21:42.95]赢了今天  然后再去赢明天 You win the day, and then you win the day after,
[21:45.40]日复一日  至死方休 and you do the same thing every day until you're dead.
[21:47.94]你被载入史册  不是因为你总赢 And you're remembered not for the winning,
[21:49.82]而是因为你从不输 but because you never lost.
[21:52.90]好了 Now...
[21:58.94]道格 Doug?
[22:01.20]道格  能听到吗 Doug, can you hear me?
[22:03.35]我现在需要些筹码 I need some leverage out here right now.
[22:05.71]-怎么了  -康威完了 - What's going on? - Conway is finished.
[22:08.83]如果他们胜选 If they win,
[22:09.62]布洛哈特会操控大局 Brockhart will do all the heavy lifting.
[22:11.11]他会成为真正的总统 He'll essentially be the president.
[22:12.65]我们该利用对手研究信息 We should have used the oppo.
[22:14.26]听着  布洛哈特是塔斯克挑的人 Listen, Brockhart is Tusk's pick.
[22:17.28]我得找办法逼那老头支持我 I need to find a way to force that old man to support me.
[22:20.28]-先生  总统先生  -听得到吗 - Sir? Mr. President? - Do you hear me?
[22:30.74]我在听 I'm here.
[22:31.39]塔斯克和波利跳达成了交易 Tusk has some deal with Pollyhop.
[22:33.42]我需要想办法阻止他们 I need to find a way to stop that.
[22:35.55]发个行政命令 An executive order...
[22:42.46]先生 Sir?
[22:46.73]稍有收敛 A little restraint...
[22:49.77]那才让人出乎意料 would be unexpected.
[22:54.51]总统先生 Mr. President?
[22:56.22]-道格  -先生 - Doug. - Sir?
[22:57.86]什么都别做 Don't do anything.
[23:00.02]我不明白 I don't understand.
[23:01.40]什么都别做  等我的指令 Don't do anything until you hear from me.
[23:03.72]-先生  波利跳交易怎么办  -听见了吗 - Sir, what about the Pollyhop deal? - Do you hear me?
[23:07.12]-什么都别...  -总统先生  我 - Don't do anything... - Mr. President, I...
[23:20.98]你打回去了吗 Have you tried calling him back?
[23:22.29]没人接  我们该做什么 There's no answer. What should we do?
[23:24.66]什么都不做  总统既然说了  那就听他的 Nothing. That's what the president said, so that's what we'll do.
[23:27.30]-让护卫把他撤出来吗  -不  我们等着 - Should we have his team pull him out? - No. We wait.
[23:30.80]夫人 Ma'am...
[23:32.46]-如果我们没能妥当处置营救的事  -道格 - if we don't handle this rescue correctly... - Doug.
[23:34.49]让我想办法让总统和佩特罗夫通上电话 Let me find a way to get the president on the phone with Petrov.
[23:37.20]不  弗兰西斯不需要分心 No. Francis doesn't need this distraction.
[23:39.33]我不同意 I disagree.
[23:41.08]我知道你不同意 I know you do.
[23:43.12]人说三代之后就没人会记得我们了 They say we're only remembered for three generations.
[23:46.39]那一个人该做些什么才能不被忘却呢 What would one have to do not to be forgotten?
[23:50.73]小本杰明知道未来是啥样 Young Benjamin here knows what's coming.
[23:54.09]谁在乎他没听说过约翰尼·卡森[主持人] Who cares if he's never heard of Johnny Carson?
[23:58.49]可怜的老塔斯克 Poor old Tusk.
[23:59.69]别看他嬉皮笑脸的  但他可骗不了我 He wears that game face, but he doesn't fool me.
[24:02.96]未来让他恐惧  因为他知道自己时日无多 The future terrifies him because he knows it's short.
[24:07.07]声明一下  我知道约翰尼·卡森是谁 For the record, I have heard of Johnny Carson.
[24:09.97]他每天晚上哄我爸妈上床 He tucked my parents into bed every night.
[24:17.39]我今天得到了特别的许可 I've been given special permission
[24:19.84]向大家展示我们的成果 to show you what we've been working on.
[24:22.29]想象这样一种可能  你的大脑  你的意识 Imagine the possibility of your brain, your consciousness,
[24:27.11]都实时进行数字化存储 stored digitally in real time.
[24:29.30]永生究竟是什么 I mean, what is immortality?
[24:31.93]终有一日  格兰特的设想也会过时 In time, even Grant's vision will get old.
[24:35.13]早晚的事  谁都免不了 It will happen, as it does for all of us.
[24:39.09]这还只是早期版本 Now this is still in the early stages,
[24:40.83]但我们一直在收集储存 but we've been collecting and storing
[24:43.48]雷蒙德的记忆  想法  怪癖和爱好 Raymond's memories, thoughts, quirks and tics.
[24:48.31]这还只是实验版本  但最终 This is a mock-up. But eventually...
[24:55.25]这个雷蒙德 this Raymond...
[24:57.03]会像各位眼前这位一样活生生 will feel as real as the one standing before you.
[25:01.01]我更喜欢脚踏实地 I like dirt and rocks...
[25:06.34]货真价实 and facts.
[25:09.48]这我也同意 No argument here.
[25:11.44]我只相信能抓在手里的  或者能亲眼看到的 I trust only what I can hold in my hand or see on my horizon.
[25:14.78]但你不能光干坐着看风景啊 Well, but you can't just sit back and admire the view.
[25:18.47]我就发现一定要紧抓当下 I've learned you've got to grab the present by the balls.
[25:22.26]那才是美国人民在乎的 That's where the American people live.
[25:24.28]你更像个推销员而不是总统  总统先生 You sound more like a salesman than a president, Mr. President.
[25:27.41]我们是美国人  我们就是推销员 Well, if we're Americans, then we are salesmen, right?
[25:29.94]这是我们天生的权利 That's our birthright.
[25:31.35]卖车  卖手机  卖汽油 Cars and phones and a gallon of gas.
[25:34.56]我眼里的美国可不是这样 That's not how I see America.
[25:37.09]我是爱国者  我为国效力 I'm a patriot. I serve.
[25:38.60]那我们向你致敬  将军 Well, then, we salute you, General.
[25:40.09]但你为国效力的意义是什么 But you serve to what purpose?
[25:42.78]不还是为了其他美国人能去推销 So the rest of America can sell.
[25:45.40]你看  这个周末  你和我 I mean, you and I, right now, this weekend,
[25:47.79]不就在这个营地推销自己吗 we're here at this camp selling ourselves.
[25:51.83]人的品质不言自明 Character speaks for itself.
[25:54.52]人民需要一个他们能信赖的总统 People want a president they can trust.
[25:56.15]错  不对  他们需要一个他们了解的总统 No, they don't. They want a president they know.
[25:59.83]而我也了解他们 And I know them.
[26:02.02]我唯一感兴趣的未来就是接下来的四年 The only future I'm interested in is the next four years.
[26:05.12]所以没错  我明天要推销  后天接着推销 So, yes, I'm selling tomorrow and the day after that
[26:08.53]大后天还要推销 and the day after that.
[26:10.23]我是在推销一个曾经住在桃子农场的男孩 I'm selling a boy who used to live on a peach farm
[26:13.19]而他现在住在白宫 who now lives in the White House.
[26:15.29]我要推销一个 I'm selling a tomorrow
[26:17.18]可触可感的明天 that you can see and touch and feel.
[26:21.67]要是你把这个夺走 Now, you take that away,
[26:22.57]我不知道这国家还剩下什么 and I don't know what this country has left.
[26:25.89]只剩下一群成年男人 Except a group of grown men
[26:28.52]围成一圈  盯着一小块屏幕 standing around in a circle, all staring at a small screen.
[26:32.51]只向内看  而不往外面看 Looking in instead of looking out.
[26:34.86]那随时给我盖一把黄土吧 Heck, give me a peck of dirt any day of the week.
[26:39.81]说得好  敬黄土 Hear, hear. To a peck of dirt.
[26:42.85]-说得好  -我要敬这一杯 - Hear, hear. - I will drink to that,
[26:44.89]也要敬将军一杯  他是位优秀的公仆 but I will also drink to the general, a good servant.
[26:49.79]敬将军 To the general.
[26:53.55]我敢肯定  这一交易随时可能落空 I promise you, this deal is on the verge of falling apart.
[26:57.24]就在重新投票之前 Right before your revote.
[26:59.41]我只是个传话的 I... I'm only the messenger, by the way.
[27:03.52]我们不能让这笔交易落空 We can't let this deal fall apart.
[27:04.98]没错  但我们必须马上救援 Agreed. But the rescue has to happen immediately.
[27:09.18]你好像跟这事有利益关系 You seem personally invested in this.
[27:11.60]不不  我只是在寻找解决方案 Oh, no, no. I'm just looking for a solution.
[27:18.26]我有个想法 I had a thought.
[27:20.85]我愿意让驻扎在乔治王岛的 I would be willing to allow the Chinese sailors
[27:23.61]中国船员登上我们的破冰船 that are stationed on King George Island to board our icebreaker.
[27:27.82]然后  在内部摄像机前 Then, purely for the in-house cameras,
[27:30.29]摆出是中国领导了此次救援的样子 we let it appear as though the Chinese led the rescue.
[27:33.27]当然  自始至终 Now, of course, the whole time,
[27:34.23]都会是美国控制船 the Americans would remain in charge of the boat,
[27:37.21]但不必让俄罗斯人知道我们参与了 but the Russians don't need to know our involvement.
[27:40.03]我觉得这是可以接受的 I imagine that would be acceptable.
[27:44.34]我马上就向徐先生转达 I'll relay this scenario to Mr. Xu immediately.
[27:46.92]我还想把关税凑整成20% But I'd also like to round up the tariff to 20%.
[27:51.61]我们已经商定19%了 We have a firm deal at 19.
[27:53.92]我知道  但突然间  这似乎不够高 I know. But suddenly, it just doesn't seem high enough.
[27:59.16]我觉得他们会答应的 I think they'll be okay with it.
[28:02.84]祈祷如此吧  我尽力 Fingers crossed. I'll do my best.
[28:06.26]-还挺顺利的  -是啊  非常顺利 - That went rather well, I think. - It did. It went very well.
[28:09.89]你超出了所有人的预料 You've exceeded everyone's expectations,
[28:11.83]整个周末你的表现很出色  但是 the way you handled yourself all weekend, but...
[28:19.40]他们能预料布洛哈特的一举一动 Brockhart's someone they can predict.
[28:22.00]话先别说太早  这事还没完 Don't get ahead of yourself. This is not over.
[28:25.79]你要干什么  弗兰西斯  你要利用对手研究吗 What are you gonna do, Francis? Are you gonna use the oppo?
[28:28.38]你似乎很着急嘛 Well, it seems to have worried you enough.
[28:31.07]他还只是副总统候选人 He's still only the vice presidential candidate.
[28:35.01]我要走了 I'm leaving.
[28:36.27]-你不用走的  -我知道  什么都不是必须的 - You don't have to go. - No, I know. I don't have to do anything.
[28:41.15]你记得我们第一次见面的情景吧 Do you remember when we first met?
[28:43.06]你差一点就加入我第二次竞选了 You almost joined my second campaign.
[28:45.52]我们坐在加夫尼的便宜馆子里 We sat down at that little greasy spoon in Gaffney.
[28:47.91]记得  要是你招了我  肯定就大获全胜了 Yeah, if you'd signed me on, you would have won by a landslide.
[28:50.73]我还是赢了  因为我从不输 I won anyway, because I never lose.
[28:54.81]你知道当时我为什么没雇你吗 You know why I didn't hire you back then?
[28:57.27]因为你去结账的时候 Because when you went to pick up the check,
[28:59.40]你告诉我不用给你钱 you told me I didn't have to pay you.
[29:01.66]你愿意不要报酬为我工作  我不信 That you would work for free. I don't trust that.
[29:05.85]因为谁也不会不要报酬 Because no one works for free.
[29:10.15]总统女士  恐怕我不能同意20% Madam President, I'm afraid I can't agree to 20%.
[29:13.91]-对经济的影响  -我们陷入僵局了 - The economic implications-- - We're at an impasse.
[29:18.04]我很希望能继续对话  但与此同时 I'm willing to keep the conversation going, but in the meantime--
[29:21.23]你们不同意  我们就不行动 We'll do nothing until you agree.
[29:24.61]总统女士  会有人丧命的 Madam President, people will die.
[29:26.74]所以我才惊讶你居然不同意我的条件 Which is why I'm surprised you won't agree to my terms.
[29:29.69]除非外交部国务委员同意 I can't agree to the terms without the approval
[29:31.76]否则我不能同意你的条件 of my State Councillor for Foreign Affairs.
[29:36.85]船上有112人 There are 112 people aboard the vessel.
[29:40.78]要是算上彼得森先生就是113人 113 if you count Mr. Peterson.
[29:44.19]20至32小时后  船就会完全沉没 Now, it will go under in 20 to 32 hours.
[29:48.01]现在南冰洋的水温 The temperature of the Southern Ocean right now
[29:50.77]是零下2摄氏度 is 28 degrees Fahrenheit.
[29:52.37]在这么冷的水里  人不到45分钟 A body will freeze to death within 45 minutes
[29:56.49]就会冻死 in water that cold.
[29:58.01]更不要说在冻死之前早就失去游泳能力了 And, of course, one loses the ability to swim long before that.
[30:05.32]徐部长  你还在吗 Minister Xu, are you still there?
[30:10.02]和佩特罗夫总统合谋永远是个错误 Collaborating with President Petrov is always a mistake.
[30:13.63]20%的关税会帮你们长长记性 The 20% tariff will help you keep that in mind.
[30:17.92]我等你回复 I'm waiting.
[30:20.09]这些人的死活取决于你了 It's up to you if they live or die.
[30:30.47]-船员呢  -全部获救 - The crew? - All rescued.
[30:34.73]撒德·彼得森呢 And Thad Peterson?
[30:36.10]你猜的没错  中国人在撒谎 You were right. The Chinese were lying.
[30:38.06]只有他仍然下落不明 He's the only one still unaccounted for.
[30:42.68]上将说还有机会拯救那艘船 The admiral says there's still a chance to save the boat.
[30:49.86]让它沉吧 Let it go down.
[30:52.41]那佩特罗夫放在船上的东西呢 And whatever Petrov has on it?
[30:54.43]我们这么做是对的  凯茜 We're doing the right thing, Cathy.
[30:57.76]你已经达到目的了  维克多 You got what you wanted, Viktor.
[31:00.07]船已经沉了  让我们接着往下谈吧 The boat is gone. Now let's get back to where we left off.
[31:03.63]你想要什么  才能换艾丹·麦卡伦回国 What will it take to get Aidan Macallan back on American soil?
[31:10.94]他挺喜欢这里的 He likes it here.
[31:26.62]要走了吗  总统先生 Leaving, Mr. President?
[31:31.79]先放车上吧  谢谢 You can put that in the car, thank you.
[31:36.03]-你没事吧  -好多了 - Are you all right? - Better now.
[31:40.24]你喝醉了 Are you drunk?
[31:42.14]-来一口吗  -不了 - You want a pull? - No.
[31:46.25]我讨厌这地方 I hate this place.
[31:48.49]这些人 These men.
[31:50.85]一个个仗着特权  趾高气扬 Their privilege, their presumption.
[31:54.62]和塔斯克的交易就是个错误 The deal with Tusk was a mistake.
[31:57.96]你知道吗 Do you know...
[32:00.60]雷蒙德想把自己冻起来 Raymond wants to be frozen?
[32:03.41]封进冰里  等将来再解冻 Put on ice until a later date.
[32:06.29]-我要走了  -威尔·康威是我的朋友  但 - I have to get going. - Will Conway's my friend. But...
[32:09.96]如果他赢了  不会有什么好结果的 this won't end well for him if he wins.
[32:13.32]你照顾好自己  本 You take care of yourself, Ben.
[32:16.48]他们有段他的录音 They have a recording of him.
[32:21.11]我马上就过去 I'll be right there in a minute.
[32:34.13]你必须向我保证 You have to promise me
[32:35.69]威尔·康威绝不能知道是我给你的 Will Conway never finds out this came from me.
[32:55.94]你知道我会成为总统吧 You know I'm gonna be the president, right?
[32:58.16]-希望如此  先生  -你希望如此 - I hope so, sir. - You hope so?
[33:01.01]我只是说我支持你  先生 I just mean I'm pulling for you, sir.
[33:03.13]我一定会成为总统 I'm gonna be the president,
[33:04.38]你也一定要把那该死的操纵杆给我 and you're going to flip me those motherfucking controls.
[33:07.14]先生 Sir!
[33:08.13]这肯定是飞行员录的 I think this must have been recorded by the pilot.
[33:10.66]我们应该先发给MSNBC和CNN We should go to MSNBC and CNN first.
[33:12.92]-我们可以大范围传播  -不  先等等 - We can go wide. - No, let's wait.
[33:17.27]弗兰西斯  你也听到了 Francis, you heard what I heard.
[33:20.46]所以留到明天效果一样好 And it'll be just as good tomorrow.
[33:22.25]让道尔来核实  明天早上见 Have Doyle confirm it. I'll see you in the morning.
[33:31.09]为什么不现在动手 Why not do it now?
[33:32.43]我们要等总统回来 We need to wait for the president.
[33:35.73]新闻持续关注 Stories are still swirling

[33:56.40]看来两位候选人终于精力不济 Exhaustion must be catching up with the candidates,
[33:58.95]安德伍德总统和他的竞选搭档周末休息 as President Underwood and his running mate took the weekend off.
[34:02.54]布洛哈特将军也不知所踪 General Brockhart was nowhere to be seen,
[34:04.75]只有康威州长 while only Governor Conway
[34:05.95]在克利夫兰地区短暂露面了两次 made a pair of quick appearances in the Cleveland area.
[34:13.11]那自来水会要你命的 That tap water is gonna kill you.
[34:15.94]还有更糟的死法 There are worse ways to go.
[34:20.73]我要坦白一件事 I have a confession.
[34:25.64]你做了什么 What'd you do?

[35:03.14]我不知我为什么那么做 I don't know why I did that.

[38:42.82]我们可以如何合作 we might be able to work together.

[40:17.13]无法离开我的公寓 I couldn't leave my apartment.
[40:20.23]为什么 Why?
[40:22.33]这种事的发生  很莫名 It's mysterious, isn't it, when these things happen?
[40:26.71]或许你没遇到过 Or maybe it never happened to you.
[40:28.77]但我有一天醒来  感觉好像... But I woke up one day and it felt like...
[40:33.62]我考虑要做的一切 everything I contemplated doing, everything,
[40:36.74]从去咖啡店 from going to the coffee shop...
[40:39.41]到看一本书  写一章书  就是很... to... reading a book, writing a chapter, it was just...
[40:45.88]可笑 laughable.
[40:50.05]什么意思 As in?
[40:52.29]就是  没有意义 As in... pointless.
[40:57.62]但多亏了凯伦 And Karen, bless her...
[41:01.05]她帮我找到了意义  不是找到 she helped me find a point. Or, not find one.
[41:05.31]而是发现找到意义的可能性 Realize the possibility of one.
[41:12.02]你们当时在一起吗 Were you together?
[41:13.63]没错  我们还结了婚 Yeah. We were married.
[41:17.10]大概三年  都是陈年旧事 For about three years. A million years ago.
[41:22.14]她人很好 She's a good person.
[41:23.93]她只是...现在状况不太好  所以我想帮她 She's just... having a hard time. So I'm trying to help her.

[42:09.77]我们不想下手太重 We don't wanna hit him too hard.
[42:10.81]不然可能被当成落井下石 There's a risk of kicking him while he's down.
[42:13.38]谁上晨间节目 Who's doing the morning shows?
[42:14.92]朋友  他们会礼貌地质疑康威的胜任能力 Friends. They'll respectfully question Conway's ability to serve.
[42:18.86]然后在晚间新闻中 And then in the nightly news,
[42:20.43]会有退休军人权利活动家争取更好的医疗 we'll have veteran rights activists arguing for better care.
[42:23.31]很好 Good.
[42:24.42]先生  计划先打击州长 Sir, the plan is to go after the governor first,
[42:27.64]等将军出面维护他 and when the general comes to his defense,
[42:29.68]我们再用他抗命的录音扳倒他 we use his hot mic comments to take him down, too.
[42:34.86]祝贺你  先生 Congratulations, sir.
[42:37.50]我想第一个祝贺你 I wanted to be the first to say it.

[43:28.44]俗世烦恼啊  散去吧 Common woe, be done.
[43:37.12]各种各样的兄弟会组织在欧美国家有着悠久的历史 其中最广为人知  同时也是同美国总统联系最多的是"共济会" 共济会成立于18世纪的英格兰  组织神秘  对会员遴选严格 会员中有许多政客  艺术家  科学家 如莫扎特  马克·吐温  发明青霉素的弗莱明等  都是共济会会员 传至美国后  同美国建国的历史一直有着千丝万缕的联系 在签署独立宣言的55人中  有9名共济会会员 而迄今为止的45任美国总统里  有15名是共济会会员  达三分之一 (其中林登·约翰逊没能完成晋级程序  未成为正式会员 所以有的统计没将他算上  认为只有14名总统真正是共济会会员) 共济会发展至今  更多是一个社交性的社会组织 但其组织严守秘密  公众对其所知甚少  因而衍生出不少骇人听闻的传说 包括这个组织怎样影响和控制了世界  其实这些说法几乎没有任何根据
[44:37.12]进入2017年后  美国媒体对俄罗斯在北极的扩张非常关注 目前普京正在对北极附近的俄罗斯军事基地 进行冷战结束后最大规模的扩张  而美国政府在这方面的动作相对落后 由于北极有着4千亿桶的原油储备  而被世界上几个大国看作战略要地 俄罗斯目前有40艘破冰船  其中6艘是核动力驱动 而美国只有2艘  其中1艘还不能工作 美国新任国防部长马蒂斯在出席自己的任命听证会时表示 美国不应该把北极的控制权拱手让给其他国家
