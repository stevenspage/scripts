[18:28.20]-新闻上铺天盖地全是她  -白噪音 - She was all over the news. - White noise.
[18:31.52]我们怎么巩固 So how do we make it stick?
[18:34.06]我能做的不多 Well, there's not much I can do.
[18:36.72]我们给你权限了  我要得到更多结果 We gave you access. I need more than I'm getting.
[18:43.78]你应该告诉我人们想要什么 You're supposed to tell me what people want.
[18:46.88]人们不知道自己想听爵士 People didn't know they wanted jazz
[18:49.31]直到他们第一次听到了爵士乐 until they heard it for the first time.
[18:51.47]我能让他们喜欢音乐  但我不能创造音乐 I can get them to like the music. I can't compose it.
[18:56.52]你得给我点材料 Give me something I can work with.
[19:11.17]我们可以把这事公诸于众吗 Is this something we could take public?
[19:12.97]不  这是机密 No, it's classified.
[19:14.86]但这太完美了  总统跟俄国人勾结 But it's perfect, the president colluding with the Russians.
[19:18.46]这个想法是可行的 The idea has merit.
[19:20.30]俄国人门路更广 The Russians will have far more access,
[19:21.70]而且也不会置美国军队于危险之中 and it doesn't put American troops in harm's way.
[19:23.69]褒奖总统的政策不会让我们得到选票的 We don't get votes by praising the president's policy.
[19:26.25]让德雷尔在委员会审议中否决它 Let's have Dreyer block it in committee.
[19:28.69]虽然我不喜欢总统最初处理哈里发国的方式 I don't like the way the president's handled ICO from the get-go,
[19:31.69]但他这次的方法也许会有效 but his approach might work here.
[19:33.21]那正是我要防止的 That's what I'm trying to prevent.
[19:36.15]你想让哈里发国的领袖继续活着 So, you wanna keep the ICO leadership alive,
[19:38.16]就为了我们能继续拿这个说事 so we can stay on message?
[19:40.32]只是拖到11月而已 Just until November,
[19:41.84]等我们就职后就狠狠打击他们 and then we'll hit 'em hard after inauguration.
[19:44.19]这正是当初让我辞职的扯淡事 This is the exact sort of BS I resigned over in the first place.
[19:48.75]在那边等我一下 I'll see you over there.
[19:51.27]我们离获胜还有两个月 Two months away from winning this thing.
[19:53.96]一旦他获得主动权  一旦他获得一点势头 But if he gains the initiative, if he picks up any momentum,
[19:56.50]都有可能影响我们的胜算 that could put us in the margin of error.
[19:58.19]我以为你不一样 I thought you were different.
[20:00.55]别胡思乱想  将军 Don't get any ideas, General.
[20:03.44]你登上我这艘船 You threw caution into the wind
[20:04.75]就已把谨慎抛到九霄云外 when you got yourself on my ticket.
[20:07.03]你再做一次  就显得愚蠢了 You do it again, you start to look foolish.

[20:29.21]我不跟记者谈 I don't talk to reporters.
[20:32.02]是关于总统的事 It's a story about the president.
[20:33.69]你没听到我说什么吗 Did you not hear me the first time?
[20:38.11]我认为在你的烧烤店里...曾发生过一些事 I think things happened... in your barbecue place.
[20:43.71]会面 Meetings.
[20:44.83]你可能顺耳听到过什么 Things you might have overheard.
[20:47.94]我觉得总统触犯了法律 I think the president broke the law,
[20:50.06]而且我觉得你知道 and I think you know about it.
[20:53.60]跟我来  找个没人能听到的地方再聊 Come with me. Let's talk where no one can hear us.
[21:11.45]-你带了录音笔吗  -是的 - So, uh, you bring a recorder? - Yeah.
[21:35.36]好  我告诉你真相 All right. Here's the truth.
[21:38.13]我不再为他工作了  我不再为他烤排骨了 I don't work for him no more. I don't serve him ribs no more.
[21:43.63]我不想再跟他有任何关系 I don't want nothing to do with him no more.
[21:46.25]即使我恨他  我也的确恨他 Even if I hated him, and I do hate him...
[21:51.55]我也不会告密  对警察  对记者 I don't snitch. Not to cops, not to reporters.
[21:55.26]对谁都不会 Not to anybody.
[21:56.94]离我远点 Leave me the fuck alone.

[22:27.22]乔治·华盛顿是位强大的领袖 George Washington was a strong commander in chief.
[22:31.96]这些品质都能在威廉·康威身上找到 William Conway embodies all these qualities.
[22:35.13]我为背书他竞选总统而骄傲 I proudly endorse his candidacy for president,
[22:38.83]我也希望我们州里的每个人都这么做 and I ask everyone in our great state to do the same.

[24:26.47]我们一生都待在这儿  也在这儿养育后代 We've been here all our lives. We raised our son here.
[24:29.31]这我们从未遇到过 It's just beyond our experience.
[24:31.27]这些人都是我们的邻居 All these folks are our neighbors.
[24:32.99]可我一把标志竖起来 But once I put that sign up...
[24:35.89]康威州长是退伍军人  而且有孩子 Governor Conway is a veteran. He has children.
[24:39.93]为什么选我们  而不是他 Why us and not him?
[24:43.75]当我们看到你们两个在党代会 When we saw you two at the convention...
[24:46.50]我说不清  看上去真像对儿好搭档 I don't know. It just seemed like a real partnership.
[24:54.59]爱  深沉  坚定的爱 Love. Deep, unwavering love.
[24:58.23]感谢你们提醒我 I wanna thank you for reminding me
[25:00.92]那种爱有多重要 how important that kind of love is.
[25:03.33]它真的很重要  我们容易忙于竞选 Because it is. It's easy to get caught up in the campaign
[25:06.10]而忘记弗兰西斯和我是怎样走到这一步的 and to forget how Francis and I got here in the first place,
[25:11.27]记得我们不仅是总统与第一夫人 to remember that we're not just President and First Lady,

[25:44.34]我是在任州长 I'm a sitting governor.
[25:45.29]获得信息没什么错 There's nothing wrong with staying informed.
[25:47.39]所有共和党人都在反对俄国的介入 Every Republican is against the Russians being involved.
[25:50.24]你是在干预国家安全 You are interfering with national security.
[25:52.76]我没摆布任何人 I haven't influenced a single member.
[25:54.42]那是因为你让布洛哈特这么做 Oh, that's because you're having Brockhart do it.
[25:57.06]如果将军提供专业建议 If the general chooses to share his expertise with them,
[25:59.71]他们当然愿意听 they're well served by it.
[26:01.14]你每天要说50次我们得摧毁哈里发国 Fifty times a day, you say we should destroy ICO,
[26:04.78]现在又故意阻止我们那么做 and now you're deliberately preventing us from doing it.
[26:07.28]你6个月前就可以摧毁他们了 You could've destroyed them six months ago,
[26:08.84]所以不要把这些都赖在我 so don't lay that at my...
[26:10.60]我不怪你骗人  州长 I don't blame you for being a fraud, Governor.
[26:12.89]我们都偶尔要伪善一下 I mean, we all have to be hypocrites, every now and then.
[26:15.50]但如果你阻止  我就得派美国军队 But if you block this, I'll send American troops in instead.
[26:19.57]你不会派美国人过去的  叙利亚不会同意的 You won't send Americans. Syria won't allow it.
[26:22.10]我不在乎叙利亚会不会同意 I don't care what Syria will allow.
[26:24.04]但你难道不希望让俄国人去冒险 But wouldn't you rather have it be Russians in harm's way,
[26:27.19]而不是美国同胞士兵吗 than your fellow American soldiers?
[26:29.77]如果有人牺牲  那将是你一手造成的 If anyone gets killed, that's going to be blood on your hands.
[26:34.13]你想让我叫共和党人同意 You want me to tell the Republicans to... get on board.
[26:37.44]或让将军去做 Or have the general do it.
[26:39.28]把政治放在一边  做正确的事 Put politics aside and do the right thing.
[26:44.43]你真以为你这通电话 Did you really think you'd be able to convince me

[26:54.90]想让我帮你 by appealing to my sense of duty?
[26:58.12]就连你都信了我的说辞 I've even got you sold on my message.
[27:03.75]你不该相信电视上看到的一切 Well, you shouldn't believe everything you see on TV.
[27:07.27]州长已挂电话了  总统先生 The governor has ended the call, Mr. President.
[27:17.88]我们走 Let's go.
[27:22.45]我们要出动自家的地面部队 We're gonna go forward with our own ground operation.
[27:24.66]我会通知参联会  先生  还有件事 I'll inform the Joint Chiefs. Sir, there's another thing.
[27:29.06]情报委员会 The Intelligence Committee...
[27:30.09]如果康威在内部有人 If Conway has someone on the inside--
[27:31.60]你是担心对监控的监督 You're worried about oversight on surveillance.
[27:34.07]人们对此更加关注了 There's increased attention.
[27:36.00]他们在打探  想弄清麦卡伦想干什么 They dig around, find out what Macallan's up to...
[27:38.19]我们不是无懈可击吗 Yeah, but I thought we were airtight.
[27:39.53]莉安那么说  但还是... Leann says we are, but still...

[28:01.74]政府事务" for the time being," end quote.
[28:03.56]但他没有表明 But he neglected to say
[28:04.85]总统何时会继续竞选 when the President would resume campaigning,
[28:07.67]目前竞选网站上 and there are no upcoming events
[28:09.17]也没有列出近期活动信息 currently listed on the campaign website,
[28:11.72]这让人推测总统缺席的真正原因 leading some to speculate that the real reason for his absence
[28:14.85]可能是身体问题 may be health-related.
[28:16.28]总统接受肝脏移植已经过去六个月了 It's been six months since the President received a liver transplant.

[36:04.40]就因为直呼你的名字吗 Just for using your name?
[36:07.85]我想不是因为名字 It wasn't the name, I suppose.

[39:06.41]康威在众议院情报委员会里有人 Conway has people on House Intelligence.
[39:09.02]我把一切都掩盖好了 I've got everything masked.

[39:13.10]只是输入的变量不一样而已 It's just a matter of what variables you input.

[39:22.14]一只勺子  我可以用来搅拌咖啡 One spoon. I can use it to stir my coffee...

[39:29.96]或是制海洛因 to boil heroin.
[39:32.68]他们只能看见勺子  看不见我用它做什么 All they see is the spoon, not what I do with it.
[39:37.88]或者我们干脆让勺子消失 Or we could just get rid of the spoon.
[39:40.07]关停吗  那太可惜了 Shut it down? Well, that would be a shame,
[39:41.85]特别是在昨天之后 especially after yesterday.
[39:44.72]-昨天发生了什么  -超越了发生 - What happened yesterday? - Beyond happened.
[39:49.80]"超越" "Beyond"?
[39:52.06]你太太在南达科塔州说的话 What your wife said in South Dakota.
[39:54.98]"超越美丽和完美" "Beyond what's pretty and perfect."
[39:57.72]摆脱习俗  过往 Liberation from convention, from the past.
[40:02.36]超越表面  超越空谈  超越竞选 Beyond surface, beyond bullshit, beyond the election.
[40:09.39]-超越婚姻  -正是 - Beyond marriage. - Yes, exactly.
[40:14.69]你们不仅是夫妻  不仅是竞选伙伴 You're not just husband and wife. You're not just running mates.
[40:17.62]你们两者兼备  却不止于此 You're both and more.
[40:20.59]你们代表了一种可能 You're what's possible.

[40:47.04]恕我直言  不过... Not to be indelicate, but...
[40:49.77]如果我成了总统吗 What if I became president?

[41:06.50]相互支撑是一回事 Supporting each other is one thing.
[41:08.28]经验是另一回事 Experience is another.
[41:10.19]你的经验很少 You have very little.
[41:13.30]从你的戒指看得出你已婚了 I can see from your ring that you're married.
[41:15.58]是的  已婚18年了 Yes. Eighteen years.
[41:16.79]所以你知道什么是真正的伙伴 So you know what real partnership is.

[41:29.70]我想说的是 What... what I'm saying is
